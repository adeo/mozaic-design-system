### Title and Subtitle

Titles and subtitles should be descriptive and as short as possible to avoid display problems and improve readability. Use clear language and avoid acronyms is recommended.

### Legend

The chart doesn't need a legend if it shows only one category of data. However, the legend may appear if the chart title is not self-explanatory. The legend is positioned at the bottom of a chart by default.

Depending on the chart, layout and context, it can be positioned horizontally or vertically, bottom or right.

*e.g. The donut legend can be displayed vertically at the bottom of the component due to its specific shape.*

### Tooltip

Chart's specific tooltips are used to hover over data points, shapes, and axis values ​​on some charts to display more details about the data.
