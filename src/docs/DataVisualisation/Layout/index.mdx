## Content

### Title and Subtitle

Titles and subtitles should be descriptive and as short as possible to avoid display problems and improve readability.   Use clear language and avoid acronyms.

### Legend

The chart doesn't need a legend if it shows only one category of data. However, the legend may appear if the chart title is not self-explanatory.

#### Default

Legends are positioned at the bottom of a chart by default.

#### Specific

Depending on the chart, layout and context, the legend can be positioned horizontally or vertically, bottom or right.

e.g. The donut legend can be displayed vertically at the bottom of the component due to its specific shape.

### Tooltip

Chart-specific tooltips are used to hover over data points, shapes, and axis values ​​on some charts to display more details about the data.
