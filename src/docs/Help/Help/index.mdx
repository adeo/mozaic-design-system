There are three main ways to get quick help from the ADEO Design System team.

## Slack.

We have some dedicated slack channels inside [ADEO's global Slack account](https://adeo-tech-community.slack.com).
Usually, we take few minutes to answer. But depending on your timezone it might get a few hours on weekdays.

## Direct contact

It's recommended to use either Slack or Github for proper and fast support. But if you prefer, you can contact Charles-Antoine Queste (Business Product Leader) directly on Slack, Workplace or by e-mail.
