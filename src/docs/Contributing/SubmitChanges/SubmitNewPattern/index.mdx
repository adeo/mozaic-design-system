<br/>

The creation of a new pattern on MOZAIC is usually done via the following workflow:

## 1. Create a new branch

Creating your new pattern starts with creating a github branch dedicated to it.  
This branch is ideally named as follows: `pattern-xxx`.

**xxx** refers to the name of your pattern _(exemple : **pattern-flags** ou **pattern-ratingstars**)_.


## 2. Create your folder structure using Plop

Plop is a simple generator.  
We use it to save bootstrapping time when creating new pattern.

To use it, simply type in your terminal `npx plop pattern`

Then the CLI will ask you 3 questions : 

- the pattern name : use a Capital first letter and no spaces (ex: Buttons)
- the pattern path : from the `src/docs` directory with no `/` at the end (ex: Components)
- the pattern order : the position of your pattern in the navigation menu (an integer - ex: 4)

At the end of the process Plop will generate the required `usage`, `code`, `specs`, `design` tabs with helping markdown content.

Here are the details of what is expected in each of these pages:

- `usage`: this page will tell you how and when to use the patterns. It will help understand what the pattern allows the user to do so you can use it right
- `code`: describe how developers should use the pattern. This is done through:
  - indicate how to implement CSS _(list the SCSS files to use/import)_
  - show the HTML code of the pattern _(use the module `<Preview/>` made available)_
  - show as many examples as possible of the pattern states _(basic state, theme variations, size variations, with icons, etc...)_
  - list all the BEM modifiers applicable to the pattern
  - indicate how to customize the pattern _(variables/mixes to be used)_
  - indicate good practices to make the pattern accessible
- `specs`: give details of the pattern specs, indicating all the values _(variables, tokens, modifiers)_ associated with each state of the pattern
- `design`: this page will be helpful for designers to know how the design file has been created and thought

Plop will also generate a basic preview.


## 3. Add all the elements (design/code) of your pattern

The documentation should at minimum contain :

- a well thought pattern name
- a short and well thought definition
- what's the pattern to be developed
- how it should works
- in what cases it should be used or not

Your folder may also contain an implementation of the pattern's scss/js code with his related live html examples.


## 4. Push your branch and create a Pull Request

Once you have finished working on your pattern, it is time to push your branch and create a Pull Request associated with your work.

Please respect the [Git conventions](http://mozaic.adeo.cloud/Contributing/GitConventions/) that we defined before pushing your work.

You will also find in the [Git conventions](http://mozaic.adeo.cloud/Contributing/GitConventions/) page, the recommended method to make your Pull Request.
