When using MOZAIC patterns, it may happen that they do not fully meet your needs. For example:

- You want to use another type of pattern variation (color, size, etc...)
- You want to use the pattern in an other usage than the one defined by default in MOZAIC
- You want to make the pattern responsive to a resolution not implemented by default in MOZAIC
- You want to make the pattern more accessible
- etc...

In these cases where an improvement of the pattern seems necessary, two possibilities are available to you:

1. Suggest a pattern enhancement
2. Submit a pattern enhancement

## Suggest a pattern enhancement

### Talk to the MOZAIC core team about it

One way to suggest a pattern enhancement is to discuss it with the MOZAIC core team.

For this purpose, the dedicated **#mozaic-support** channel is available on [Adeo's global Slack account](https://adeo-tech-community.slack.com/).

### Create an Issue on Github

Another method _(recommended)_ is to create an **Issue** in the [MOZAIC project on Github](https://github.com/adeo/mozaic-design-system/issues/new/choose) using the dedicated template.

## Submit a pattern enhancement

If you have the opportunity, you can directly submit the improvement you want to implement by creating a Pull Request.

For more details, please read our [documentation about Pull Request](/contributing/developers/git-conventions/#pull-requests).

Note that a pattern enhancement require only the core team validation to be merged.
