### Note about the project architecture

The project Use a monorepo architecture using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/).
Lerna help us to manage the distribution and the versionning of multiple packages into the same repository.
It also create symlink between the individual packages nodes_modules so they can be used in one another as npm dependencies.

When releasing the design system, lerna will automaticaly generate changelogs for the global/parent repo, as well as for the individual packages and select a version number based on the commit syntax. It's why it is very important that you follow the [contributing guidelines](/Contributing/Prerequisite/GitConventions/).

please [read the docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/) to learn more about it.

`yarn develop previews=Components/Buttons`
