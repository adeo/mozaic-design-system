## Development :

### Note about the project architecture

The project use a monorepo architecture using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/).
Lerna help us to manage the distribution and the versioning of multiple packages into the same repository.
It also create symlink between the individual packages nodes_modules so they can be used in one another as npm dependencies.

When releasing the design system, lerna will automatically generate changelogs for the global/parent repo, as well as for the individual packages and select a version number based on the commit syntax. It's why it is very important that you follow the [contributing guidelines](/Contributing/Developers/GitConventions/).

Please [read the docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/) to learn more about it.

### Clone the repo and start the development environment

Clone the repo :

```bash
git clone git@github.com:adeo/mozaic-design-system.git
```

Move to the repo:

```bash
cd mozaic-design-system
```

Install dependencies and create symlink between packages:

```bash
yarn lerna
```

Add a github personal access tokens :
[follow those instruction](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and select `repo` as a scope for you personal access token.
Copy your token in your clipboard

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the following (replacing XXX by your token):

```
GH_API_TOKEN=XXX
```

```

## Targeting compillation of selected previews directory

Compiling previews take a long time, and most of the time you need only to compile the previews you are working on.

To target only previews contained in a directory, add a preview parameter to the develop command containing a path relative to `src/pages/`:

```bash
yarn develop previews=Components/Buttons
```

## Lint and fix your css files using stylelint

```bash
yarn css:fix
```

Please note that stylelint is not able to fix everything, so run

```bash
yarn css:lint
```

and make the required changes.

stylelint `fix` and `lint` are run at pre-commit, so you can't commit uggly stuffs ;).

## Create a production build :

```bash
yarn build
```

## CI/CD

If you want more explanation, please go to the related [wiki page](https://github.com/adeo/mozaic-design-system/wiki/CI-CD).
