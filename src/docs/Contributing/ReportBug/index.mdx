We do our best to make MOZAIC a simple, turnkey, and stable tool; however, you may encounter bugs when using it _(see below the section "What we call a bug" for more information)_.

If you discover a bug when using a MOZAIC component, please tell us.  
For this, two solutions are available to you:

## Create an Issue

One way to report a bug is to **create an issue** in the [MOZAIC project on Github](https://github.com/adeo/mozaic-design-system/issues) using the dedicated template.

However, another option _(recommended)_ is available to you, that of creating a Pull Request.

## Create a Pull Request

If you have the opportunity, we recommend you to submit a **Pull Request** containing the correction to this bug.

For more details, please read our [documentation about Pull Request](http://mozaic.adeo.cloud/Contributing/GitConventions/#pull-request).

## What we call a bug

Among the bugs you may encounter, here are some examples we have identified:

- Design issue
  - **non usable**: the symbol can't be customized
  - **usage doesn't correspond**: the symbol doesn't correspond to the purpose for which it is to be used
  - **not responsive**: the symbol behaves badly on some or all screen resolutions
- Dev' issue
  - **broken preview**: previewing the code of a component doesn't work
  - **HTML error**: the HTML code doesn't behave as indicated in the documentation
  - **CSS error**: CSS doesn't match the associated HTML / CSS doesn't load / there is an error in the CSS code
  - **icon error**: the icon name doesn't match the visual / the icon doesn't load / you have the wrong icon size
  
This list isn't exhaustive, so if you encounter a bug that doesn't appear in the cases mentioned above, don't hesitate to contact us via the channel **#mozaic-support** on [Adeoâ€™s global Slack account](https://adeo-tech-community.slack.com).
