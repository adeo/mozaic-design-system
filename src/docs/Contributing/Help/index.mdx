> There are three main ways to get quick help from Mozaic. And theyâ€™re all pretty simple:

## 1 - Via Slack.

We have a dedicated slack channel inside [Adeoâ€™s global Slack account](https://adeo-tech-community.slack.com). Itâ€™s called **#mozaic-support**. Usually, we take few minutes to answer. But depending on your timezone it might get a few hours on week-days.  
_Thereâ€™s just one rule: Questions should be posted in English._

## 2 - Via Github

Thereâ€™s another way, in case you donâ€™t have access to slack, we can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/adeo/mozaic-design-system/issues) as well. We might take a few hours to check that. Truth is, weâ€™re not that used to receive GitHub issues. But as far as this gets popular, our response time will gain speed proportionally.

## 3 - Via e-mail

Old but gold, e-mails never fail. But itâ€™s true that it might take more time for us to answer via this channel. So weâ€™d prefer to recommend you using either Slack or Github for proper and fast support.  
Currently, we support English, French, and Portuguese by e-mail ðŸ™ƒ ! : tiago.rosa (at) adeo (dot) com

For now, you can ask our help with any topic related to Mozaicâ€™s usage, application, installation, contribution and such.

Itâ€™s not weird if we provide you with a link for documentation that would help saving time for both parties. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™d be really useful if you could provide us with feedback after reading documentation. **Thank you!**
