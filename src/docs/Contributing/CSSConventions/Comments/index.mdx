> Comments are non-executable statements, which are placed in source code.
> Comments make source code easier to understand. So you can use as much code comments as you want.

## Basics

Two types of comments can be used in SCSS files:

- **Multi-line comments** _(also called native CSS comments)_: Start with `/*` and end at the next `*/`
- **Single line comments**: Start with `//`, and go until the end of the line

```SCSS
.mc-button {
  
  /* this is a native CSS comments */
  &__text {
    /*...*/
  }
    
  // this is a single line comments
  &__wrapper {
    /*...*/
  }
}
```

### Behavior during compilation

Each of these types of comments behaves differently when compiling the SCSS file into a CSS file.

Indeed, **Single line comments** are **not rendered** in the final CSS file. This is why single line comments are often called **silent comments**, because they don't produce any CSS.

On the other hand, **Multi-line comments** are **always rendered** in the final CSS file. They're also called **loud comment**, by contrast with silent comments.

By default, multi-line comments be stripped from the compiled CSS in compressed mode.  
If a comment begins with `/*!`, though, it will always be included in the CSS output.

```SCSS
.mc-button {
  // This comment won't be included in the CSS.
  
  /* But this comment will, except in compressed mode. */
  
  /*! This comment will be included even in compressed mode. */
}
```

## General purpose comments in the top of your file

If you think this is required you can add a general purpose comment in the top of your file, for that, use the SCSS single line comment:

```SCSS
// File containing the styles of the .mc-button component
// as well as the different variations of colors or sizes
// Don't forget to import the _all-settings.scss file to use variables and mixins

.mc-button {
  /*...*/
}
```

## Supports comment

You should avoid support comments, but it is possible when required to add comments on code blocks to give information about **what is left to do** or more importantly **what is here for legacy support purpose only**.

Please consider that the **TODOS are not a good practice** and that using the project management tool for that is way better.

For this type of comment, **use native CSS comments**.  
Add the **capitalized flags `LEGACY_SUPPORT` and `END_LEGACY_SUPPORT` at the start and at the end** of the legacy support code block.
Add also **the version in witch the support is supposed to be dropped**.

```SCSS
.mc-button {
    
  /* LEGACY SUPPORT : will be removed in version 2 */
  &__text {
    /*...*/
  }
  /* END LEGACY SUPPORT */

  // replace .go-my-block__toto in version 1.9.6 and higher
  &__wrap {

    /* TODO: do something (this should be avoided in production) */
    /*...*/
  }
}
```

## Tokens comment

Design tokens are theming/styling constants defined in a JSON file.  
For more information about tokens, please read the ["Design Tokens" chapter](http://mozaic.adeo.cloud/GetStarted/Developers/whatsincluded/#design-tokens-) in the **Getting started** section.

It is possible to add a comment to a token property, simply by adding a new `key/value` pair to the JSON file.  
The key must be named `comment` and the value contains the comment you want to write.

```JSON
{
  "color": {
    "star": {
      "empty": {
        "value": "{color.grey.200.value}",
        "comment": "color for empty star"
      },
      "focus": {
        "value": "{color.secondary-blue.500.value}",
        "comment": "color for star on focus"
      },
      "hover": {
        "value": "{color.secondary-orange.300.value}",
        "comment": "color for star on hover"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The comment will also appear in the output files, if they accept the comments:

_example of a scss output file:_

```SCSS
$color-star-empty: #d3d2d6 !default; // color for empty star
$color-star-focus: #25a8d0 !default; // color for star on focus
$color-star-hover: #ffc17d !default; // color for star on hover
```
