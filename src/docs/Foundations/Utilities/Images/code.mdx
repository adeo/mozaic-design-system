> 2. By using ratio helpers

> The following documentation represents both of these approaches.

## Using the `set-ratio` mixin

### Import

In order to use Mozaic ratios via the `set-ratio` mixin, you must first import the `_all-settings.scss` file:

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';
```

### Usage

Once you have imported the `_all-settings.scss` file all you need to do is use the `set-ratio` mixin in your code as follows:

```scss
.your-element {
  @include set-ratio('1x1');
}
```

#### Mixin allowed value

The mixin `set-ratio` accepts the following values:

| ratio    | mixin allowed value |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| **1:1**  | `1x1`               |
| **2:3**  | `2x3`               |
| **3:2**  | `3x2`               |
| **3:4**  | `3x4`               |
| **4:3**  | `4x3`               |
| **16:9** | `16x9`              |

## Using ratio helpers

### Import

Another way to use Mozaic ratios in your code is to use the ratio helpers.

To do this, you need to import the `_all-settings.scss` file, as well as the `_u.ratio.scss` file.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';
@import 'utilities/_u.ratio.scss';
```

### Usage

Once you have made all your imports, you just need to add the following elements to your code:

1. Add the class `mu-ratio` followed by a modifier corresponding to the ratio you want to use such as `mu-ratio--16x9`.
2. Add class `mu-ratio__item` on the child element

```html
<div class="parent-element mu-ratio mu-ratio--16x9">
  <iframe class="mu-ratio__item"></iframe>
</div>
```

<Preview path="ratio-with-helpers" />

#### List of modifiers to be used

Here is the list of modifiers you can use according to the expected ratio:

| ratio    | associated modifier |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| **1:1**  | `mu-ratio--1x1`     |
| **2:3**  | `mu-ratio--2x3`     |
| **3:2**  | `mu-ratio--3x2`     |
| **3:4**  | `mu-ratio--3x4`     |
| **4:3**  | `mu-ratio--4x3`     |
| **16:9** | `mu-ratio--16x9`    |
