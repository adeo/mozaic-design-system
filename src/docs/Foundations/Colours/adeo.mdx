> The design system offers an adaptive and scalable colour system. The colour palette has been divided into four categories: **Primary colours**, **Secondary colours**, **Greys** and **Status colours**.

# Primary colour

Primary colour is the brand colour. It is the key component for our users to live and adopt ADEO's experience.

## Primary 01

The primary is the essence of the brand **ADEO**.

# Secondary colours

Secondary colours are essential to your design. We need them on many occasions to accentuate our primary colours and to deliver a specific message.

## Secondary Blue-Grey

Secondary Blue-Grey is mostly used for background.

<Swatch preset="adeo" id="secondary-blue" />

## Secondary Purple

Secondary Purple is used to create a visual rythm with the Primary colour.

<Swatch preset="adeo" id="secondary-purple" />

# Greys

We used the same principles to design our greyscale but greys are based on **11 values** swatches. Greys have specific use cases for **UI elements**:

- Texts & Titles
- Icons
- Backgrounds

# Status colours

Status colours convey various levels of importance for feedback information, like errors or warnings. They can also highlight important pieces of information or some tips. Status colours can also inform the user that an operation has failed or succeeded.

## Information

This colour is used to highlight important pieces of information the user should be aware of.
Should only be used if the information does not represent a threat.

<Swatch preset="adeo" id="info" />

## Success

Informs the user that an operation was successful.

<Swatch preset="adeo" id="success" />

## Warnings

Inform the user about risks or threats. It teels the user to be careful about something.

<Swatch preset="adeo" id="warning" />

## Danger

This colour informs the user of an error or that some operation went wrong.

<Swatch preset="adeo" id="danger" />
