# Primary colour

Primary colour is the brand colour. It is the key component for our users to live and adopt ADEO's experience.

## Primary 01

The primary is the essence of the brand **ADEO**.

<ColorPalette preset="adeo" id="primary-01" />

# Greys

We used the same principles to design our greyscale but greys are based on **11 values** swatches. Greys have specific use cases for **UI elements**:

- Texts & Titles
- Icons
- Backgrounds

# Secondary colours

Secondary colours are essential to your design. We need them on many occasions to accentuate our primary colours and to deliver a specific message.

## Blue-Grey

Mostly used for backgrounds.

<ColorPalette preset="adeo" id="secondary-blue" />

## Purple

Secondary Purple is used to create a visual rythm with the Primary colour.

<ColorPalette preset="adeo" id="secondary-purple" />

## Sand-Grey

Mostly used for backgrounds.

<ColorPalette preset="adeo" id="secondary-sandgrey" />

# Status colours

Status colours convey various levels of importance for feedback information, like errors or warnings. They can also highlight important pieces of information or some tips. Status colours can also inform the user that an operation has failed or succeeded.

## Information

This colour is used to highlight important pieces of information the user should be aware of.
Should only be used if the information does not represent a threat.

<ColorPalette preset="adeo" id="info" />

## Success

Informs the user that an operation was successful.

<ColorPalette preset="adeo" id="success" />

## Warnings

Inform the user about risks or threats. It teels the user to be careful about something.

<ColorPalette preset="adeo" id="warning" />

## Danger

This colour informs the user of an error or that some operation went wrong.

<ColorPalette preset="adeo" id="danger" />
