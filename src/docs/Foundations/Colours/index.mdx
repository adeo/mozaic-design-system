> ADEO Design System offers an adaptive and scalable colour system based on UI rules to maintain consistency, harmony and a high level of accessibility for our users.

## Fundamentals

As a Customer-centric company, users must be our priority. To help the product teams and optimise their worlflow, thinking and choices, some functional colours have been designed to cover the different UI elements like texts, backgrounds and so on, and then, improve the user experience.
Thanks to follow and apply the colour rules provided by the design system to keep a consistency between the products.
Based on the 60-30-10 Rule, we set up a functional colour palette to revalorise the brand colour or the specific actions depending on the brand and its branding.

### The 60–30–10 Rule

We use the rule to apply a well-balanced colour system across the ADEO's products. 60% of an interface should use a neutral colour, 30% should use a primary or secondary colour and 10% should use an accent colour.

| Degree | Usages |
| -- | -- |
| 60% | Background, texts, icons |
| 30% | Common actions, minor actions, navigation |
| 10% | Most important elements or actions, conversion elements |

## Functional colours

### Brand

Brand colours must be applied with moderation and to emphasise a visual or textual element. Keep in mind that some components already use the brand colours.

### Text

Text elements should use neutral colours to prevent users from confusing them with interactive elements. In specific cases, product teams need to assess the need of adding a brand or accent colour to a non-interactive text element.

### Background

The background is a simple way to create rhythm, separate elements on a page or highlight an item or section. To help product teams in their choices, the design system offers two types of backgrounds, neutral or accentuated.

### Status

The design system offers a simplified and flexible colour palette to cover semantic elements, such as status or feedback.

### Disabled

Although a disabled element does not have to be accessible, as designers and developers we consider that anything we share with a user has a role in the experience and should achieve a minimum level of accessibility (contrast ratio of 3:1). To simplify its usage, the design system offers a background and a foreground colour.
