> LEROY MERLIN offers an adaptive and a scalable color system. These colors have been defined using [HSLA](#hsla) color swatches. The color palette has been divided in three categories : **primary colors**, **secondary colors** and **greys**.

# Primary colors

Primary colors are the brand colors. They are the key components for our users to live and adopt the Leroy Merlin's experience. These are the two primary colors palettes we use in this design system.

## Grayscale

We used the same principles to design our greyscale but greys are based on **11 values** swatches. Greys have specific use cases for **UI elements** :

- Texts & Titles
- Icons
- Backgrounds

# Secondary colors

Secondary colors are essential to our designs. We need them in many occasions to accent our primary colors and to deliver a specific message such as discounts and special offers.

## Secondary Blue

Secondary Blue is mostly used for focus or informative contents.

# Anatomy

In this system, every color has a `dark` and a `light` variant that can be used to adapt to different usages from text to illustrations.

In order to have this flexibility we designed color swatches based on **9 values** for primary and secondary colors. It means that you can use 9 values of the same color to fit your design needs.

> <a name="hsla">HSLA</a> is a way to define colors based on three properties : **Hue**, **Saturation**, **Light** and \*\*Alpha\*\*. We decided to use this standard to have more consistency between colors. It is also easier to relate colors to each other when they are based on HSLA.

This system allows the team to have every tint it needs to design every situation. It answers typography problems, illustration needs and it also allows to contrast with deep background colors. Here is an example showing how it works based on our Primary-01 Secondary-Purple colors.

> The design needs to be accessible to everyone and these swatches when combined properly are compliant with color contrast rules for accessibility
