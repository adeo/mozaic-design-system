> Mozaic offers an adaptive and a scalable color system. These colors have been defined using [HSLA](/Foundations/Colors/#anatomy) color swatches. The color palette has been divided in four categories : **Primary colors**, **Secondary colors** ,**Greys** and **Status colors**.


<Highlight theme="warning" title="Be aware">

You will discover that colors are duplicated in some cases. This may seems strange to you, but we need to think about other brands and cultures to allow them to customize the colors.

For example, the success color may not be green in another country, and the primary brand color may not be usable for success with another brand.

**It is why you should take a special care to use the right color variable for the right usage.**

# Primary colors

Primary colors are the brand colors. They are the key components for our users to live and adopt the LEROY MERLIN's experience. These are the two primary colors palettes we use in this design system.

## Primary 01

The primary green is the essence of the **LEROY MERLIN** brand.

# Greys

We used the same principles to design our greyscale but greys are based on **11 values** swatches. Greys have specific use cases for **UI elements** :

- Texts & Titles
- Icons
- Backgrounds

# Status colors

Status colors convey various levels of importance for feedback informations, like errors or warning. They can also highlight important informations or tips for the user or inform him that an operation had fail of succeded.

# Secondary colors

Secondary colors are essential to your design. We need them in many occasions to accent our primary colors and to deliver a specific message such as discounts and special offers. Those guidelines may vary depending on the country and culture you live in.

Secondary Blue is mostly used for focus.
Use the [info]() swatch to highlight anything related to informational feedback for your users.

# Anatomy

In this system, every color has a `dark` and a `light` variant that can be used to adapt to different usages from text to illustrations.

In order to have this flexibility we designed color swatches based on **9 values** for primary and secondary colors. It means that you can use 9 values of the same color to fit your design needs.

> HSLA is a way to define colors based on three properties : **Hue**, **Saturation**, **Light** and **Alpha**. We decided to use this standard to have more consistency between colors. It is also easier to relate colors to each other when they are based on HSLA.

This system allows the team to have every tint it needs to design every situation. It answers typography problems, illustration needs and it also allows to contrast with deep background colors. Here is an example showing how it works based on our Primary-01 Secondary-Purple colors.

> The design needs to be accessible to everyone and these swatches when combined properly are compliant with color contrast rules for accessibility
