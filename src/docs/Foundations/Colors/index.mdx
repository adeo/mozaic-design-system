> LEROY MERLIN offers an adaptive and a scalable color system. These colors have been defined using [HSLA](#hsla) color swatches. The color palette has been divided in four categories : **primary colors**, **secondary colors** ,**greys** and **feedbacks colors**.

You will discover that colors are duplicated in some cases. This may seems strange to you, but we need to think about other brands and cultures to allow them to customize the colors.

For example, the success color may not be green in another country, and the primary brand color may not be usable for success with another brand.

**It is why you should take a special care to use the right color variable for the right usage.**

# Primary colors

Primary colors are the brand colors. They are the key components for our users to live and adopt the Leroy Merlin's experience. These are the two primary colors palettes we use in this design system.

## Primary 01

The primary green is the essence of the **LEROY MERLIN** brand.

## Grayscale

We used the same principles to design our greyscale but greys are based on **11 values** swatches. Greys have specific use cases for **UI elements** :

- Texts & Titles
- Icons
- Backgrounds

# Anatomy

In this system, every color has a `dark` and a `light` variant that can be used to adapt to different usages from text to illustrations.

In order to have this flexibility we designed color swatches based on **9 values** for primary and secondary colors. It means that you can use 9 values of the same color to fit your design needs.

> HSLA is a way to define colors based on three properties : **Hue**, **Saturation**, **Light** and **Alpha**. We decided to use this standard to have more consistency between colors. It is also easier to relate colors to each other when they are based on HSLA.

This system allows the team to have every tint it needs to design every situation. It answers typography problems, illustration needs and it also allows to contrast with deep background colors. Here is an example showing how it works based on our Primary-01 Secondary-Purple colors.
