## Recommended sizes

### Heading Medium

Heading medium are supposed to be used as the default heading style for your pages. Every breakpoint has a default value that should be used in most cases.

|  Breakpoint                 |  Heading size   |
| --------------------------- | --------------- |
| `S` (320px and up)          | 28px (1.75mu)   |
| `M` (680px and up)          | 34px (2.125mu)  |
| `L` to `XL` (1024px and up) | 41px (2.5625mu) |

<HintItem dont>
  Don't use a larger size for your text elements than the heading size in your pages. This will help you maintain a consistent hierarchy.

## Specific needs

This heading styles system still allows you to answer specific needs depending on the content of your pages or your section.

### Heading Small

These heading styles sizes are the smallest sizes you can use for your titles.

|  Breakpoint                 |  Heading size  |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| `S` (320px and up)          | 23px (1.75mu)  |
| `M` (680px and up)          | 28px (1.75mu)  |
| `L` to `XL` (1024px and up) | 34px (2.125mu) |

### Heading Large

| `S` (320px and up)          | 34px (2.125mu)  |

## Variations

There are two different font-weights available for your text headings.

| Font-weight | Usage                                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regular     | Use this font-weight for your common text headings                   |
| SemiBold    | This font-weight allows you to visually emphasise your text headings |

### Text colors

You can use the darkest or the lightest font color depending on the background color. This choice must be made with accessibility in mind.

### Underlined headings

In some cases, your title can be a combination of a text and an underline. These underlined headings can be useful when you need to give more importance to your heading or make visual separations.

  Please note that underlined headings are available in **SemiBold only**.
