> The body patterns provide basic typographic styles for readable multilines text or paragraphs like a product description or an article.

Body styles are patterns meant to help you use consistent typographic hierarchy with the context and across responsive viewports. It's mainly reserved for users wishing to focus on tasks with added value and user experience. Text classes are families of several font-sizes and help create a hierarchy of contents.

#### Body styles are defined with three factors :

- Font-size _(that may vary depending on the viewport)_
- Line-height _(that are optimised for readability and accessibility)_
- Font-weight _(regular or semi-bold)_

#### And comes with two variations for each class :

Each body pattern comes with a modifier to set the font-weight to **'semi bold'** and a modifier to use an alternative **line-height**.
