> UX Writing is the art of crafting clear, concise, and user-centric texts to meet the needs of our users. It involves finding the right words to make our interfaces simple, efficient, and enjoyable.

Five fundamental principles should always guide our writing to achieve this goal:

### Clarity

Our texts must be clear and understandable for all users, regardless of their level of knowledge.

### Conciseness

Our texts should be to the point, without burdening the user with unnecessary information. Each word must serve a purpose.

### Utility

Our texts should bring value to the users by guiding them and always providing relevant information.

### Empathy

Our texts should be crafted with the user in mind, fulfilling their expectations, respecting their emotions, and anticipating potential issues.

### Human first

Our texts should embody the warmth and kindness of our in-store advisors. They should feel like an exchange rather than a one-sided conversation.
