## Major breakpoints

Major breakpoints are expressed in tee-shirt sizes letters, they are meant to provide an easy access to major devices types :

> Please note that devices types cannot be detected through viewport widths, and those are just aproximations.

| viewport          | token        | corresponding devices types     |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **0px** and up    | `screen.s`   | phones                          |
| **680px** and up  | `screen.m`   | tablets and tiny labtops        |
| **1024px** and up | `screen.l`   | landscape tablets, laptops      |
| **1280px** and up | `screen.xl`  | laptops (depending on settings) |
| **1920px** and up | `screen.xxl` | desktop                         |

## Minor breakpoints

Each major breakpoint come with some minor ones, meant to give a more fine control over design for certain devices. You may never use them and **you should avoid it whenever possible** to keep things simple.

Minor breakpoints start with the name of a major one and use the following sizes declinaisons :

- medium
- large
- xlarge

Using a mobile first approach, a minor breakpoint is inevitabily bigger than the Major one :
