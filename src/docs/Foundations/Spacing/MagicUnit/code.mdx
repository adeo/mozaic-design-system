# Using magic unit in SCSS

The magic unit is a `scss` variable generated from tokens: `$magic-unit`.

This variable is a unitless value equal to `16`.

## Why a unitless value?

First, we want to express sizes in `rem` units.
If you don't know why, [read this first](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/).

### So, what's the problem?

Well, depending on the team code base that uses it, the value of `1rem` may be different... The value of `1rem` is defined by the `font-size` property attached to the root element (html on the web).

```scss
/* it's not uncommon to see this */
html {
  font-size: 62.5%; /* 62.5% of 16px is 10px */
}

.my-element {
  margin-bottom: 1.6rem; /* 16px, easier for px/rem convertions */
}
```

By default, the `rem` is equal to `16px`:

```scss
html {
  /* ...nothing here redifining the font-size */
}

.my-element {
  margin-bottom: 1.6rem; /* 1.6 x 16px = 25,6px... yerk! */
}
```

### Ok, so how do we make this work?

We added a token where you can define your local pixel value of `1rem`. It's exposed in scss as `$local-rem-value`. This value is set to `16` by default. Then, to get a rem value of `$magic-unit`, we divide it by `$local-rem-value`:

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';

.my-element {
  /* suposing your rem equal 16px */
  margin-bottom: ($magic-unit/$local-rem-value) * 1rem; /* return 1rem = 16px */

  /* suposing your rem equal 10px */
  margin-bottom: ($magic-unit/$local-rem-value) * 1rem; /* return 1.6rem = 16px */
}
```

To make things easier, we created a sass function that do that for you:

**the `to-rem()` sass function:**

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';
/* your rem ($local-rem-value) can by equal either to 10px or 16px */
.my-element {
  margin-bottom: to-rem($magic-unit); /* return 1.6rem or 1rem = 16px */
}
```

## You got it! But there is more:

We created multiple things to help you work better with the magic unit:

- the function `magic-unit()`
- the function `magic-unit-rem()`
- the variables `$mu025` to `$mu1000`

here their respectives API:

### The magic-unit function

> The **magic-unit function** returns a **unitless** multiplication of the magic unit **expressed in px**, and expects a **multiplier** parameter.

Following the rules of granularity, it will accept a multiplier parameter:

- of `0.25` increments for multiplier less than 2
- of `0.5` increments for multipliers greater than 2 and less than 4
- integers for multipliers greater than 4

**It is particularly useful when you need to make calculations.**

Imagine you create a button. You want it to have exactly 2.5 x magic-unit height when on one line, but still be able to grow in unexpected uses cases, if the text is forced on two lines.

One valid approach could be the following:

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';

.my-button {
  // define local variables
  $vertical-paddings: magic-unit(0.5);
  $desired-total-height: magic-unit(2.5);

  padding-top: to-rem($vertical-paddings);
  padding-bottom: to-rem($vertical-paddings);
  line-height: to-rem($desired-total-height - ($vertical-paddings * 2));
}
```

<Hint type="dont">
    <HintItem dont>
        Don't use an invalid multiplier parameter: <code>magic-unit(0.6792)</code>. <br />The magic-unit function will throw an error and prevent the css compilation.
    </HintItem>
    <HintItem dont>
        Avoid using custom multiplications: <code>magic-unit*12</code>. <br /> That way you can be sure to use an authorized value.
    </HintItem>
</Hint>

### The magic-unit-rem function

> The **magic-unit-rem function** behaves exactly as the magic-unit function does, exept **it returns a rem value**.

It basically just do the `to-rem()` part for you

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';

.my-element {
  margin-bottom: magic-unit-rem(0.25);
  /* is equivalent to */
  margin-bottom: to-rem(magic-unit(0.25));
}
```

### The shorthands variables

> The **shorthands variables** behaves exactly as the magic-unit-rem, but in a variable form factor.

### The magic unit grid development utility

In order to help you to position your elements according to the magic-unit, Mozaic provides the css class `mdu-magic-unit-grid` to apply on your container and shows a positioning grid.

The `mdu-magic-unit-grid` class is only usable in a development mode, indeed the code of this class will not be compiled into the production build when the **MOZAIC_ENV=production** environment variable is provided.

<Story id="foundations-magic-unit--magic-unit-grid" />

> As a reminder, you can define an environment variable to determine whether you want to use Mozaic in development or environment mode. For more information on this subject, [see the dedicated document](/get-started/developers/installation/postcss/#compiling-for-production).
