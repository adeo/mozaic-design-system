> An icon is a graphic representation of an object, a message or a movement. It's different from an illustration because of its simplistic aspect. An icon must be **recognisable at first sight** so that the user can understand the information or the action it is intended to represent. Icons may be a visual guide to help the user to navigate on leroymerlin.fr faster.

## Principles

An icon must be :

<br />
<br />
<HintItem>Easy to understand</HintItem>
<HintItem>Abstract</HintItem>
<HintItem>Visual</HintItem>
<HintItem>Outlined</HintItem>

## Use cases

An icon can be used in different cases on leroymerlin.fr.

#### 1. Buttons and links

Icons allows to emphasise an action et make it easier to understand. An icon can be used in a button without a label to gain space in interfaces.

#### 2. Dropdown and input

In these cases, the icon is used to guide the user in the action he needs to do. It's also a visual help about the content of the box that is going to open.

#### 3. Quantity and scrolling

Icons can be used to change a quantity or to scroll different options. Icon use in this case is totally functional and usually results of two opposed actions.

#### 4. Close and delete

Close icons are very well know by users to close panels or delete options.

#### 5. Illustration and informative

Icons are used to illustrate what is going to detail.
