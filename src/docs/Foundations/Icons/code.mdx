All icon components are only wrappers for SVG. It has been done that way to facilitate the integration in your technology.

### Angular

The icon set doesn't contains Angular components. You must use the svgs icon type. 
In order to add the svgs to your project you can add the following code to your build: 

```
{
  "glob": "**/*",
  "input": "./node_modules/@mozaic-ds/icons/svg/",
  "output": "./assets/images"
}
```
