## Import

Import the settings and the listbox `scss` files.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';

@import 'components/c.checkbox';
@import 'components/c.listbox';
```

## Usage

The creation of an listbox component in your code is done using the following HTML structure:

### Mono selection
```HTML
  <ul
    tabindex="-1"
    role="listbox"
    aria-labelledby="listbox"
    class="mc-listbox"
  >
    <li class="mc-listbox__item" role="option">
      <span class="mc-listbox__text">Option label</span>
    </li>
    ...
  </ul>
```

### Multi selection
```HTML
  <ul
    tabindex="-1"
    role="listbox"
    aria-labelledby="listbox"
    class="mc-listbox"
  >
    <li class="mc-listbox__item" role="option">
      <span class="mc-listbox__text">Option label</span>
    </li>
    ...
  </ul>
```

## Variations

### Mono selection

This variation is mostly combined with direct action or with a dropdown component.
To display a checked item, you have to add the modifier `is-checked` on the `li` element.

<Preview path="default" />

### Multi selection

In order to use the listbox with a multi selection, you must use checkboxes inside the items. 
To achieve that you have to add the class `mc-listbox__checkbox` to checkbox components.


<Preview path="multiselect" />

### Icons 
To be more explicit, you may want to add an icon before the item label. 
To achieve that you have to add the class `mc-listbox__icon` to your icons. 

<Preview path="icons" />

### Left opening
In some cases, you may want to open the listbox in the left side of the trigger. 
To achieve that you have to add the modifier `mc-listbox--left` to `mc-listbox` element.


<Preview path="trigger" />

## Behaviour
<Highlight theme="warning">

The items states can only be manage by javascript. 

</Highlight>

### Open

### Focus
