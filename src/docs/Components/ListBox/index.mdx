| Data           | Preview                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Text only      | <Preview path="default" nude />|

| Text with image (logo, picture) | <Preview path="icons" nude />  |
| Text with flag | -- coming soon --              |

## Behaviours

A listbox can't be used alone. It always must be triggered by an element like an input, a button or an icon.
