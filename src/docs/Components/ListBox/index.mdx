### Data Content

The Listbox allows to display several types of data.

| Data           | Preview                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Text only      | -- Preview to be added --     |
| Text with logo | -- Preview to be added --     |
| Text with icon | <Preview path="icons" nude /> |
| Text with flag | -- Preview to be added --     |

## Behaviours

A listbox can't be used alone. It always must be triggered by an element like an input, a button or an icon.
