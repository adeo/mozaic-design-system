## Import

Import the settings and the checkbox `scss` files.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/_all-settings';

@include import-font-families();

@import 'components/_c.file-uploader';
```

## Basic usage

> Natively, to upload files we use an `<input type="file"/>`, but in Mozaic, we will customize it with a `<label>` that will act as a button.

Wrap a input[type="file"] and a label inside a div and apply the following classes :

<Preview path="file-uploader" />

## Behaviors

### Standard file uploader states :

- `hover`
- `focus`
- `disabled`

<Preview path="file-uploader-all-states" />

## Validation pattern

### Multiple files

You can choose to upload **several files at the same time** with the multiple attribute.

<Preview path="file-uploader-multiple" />

### Accept type of files

You can also restrict the type or the path of the file to be uploaded.
`accept=".jpg, .jpeg, .png"` or `accept="image/*`

<Preview path="file-uploader-accept" />

## Accessibility and semantic

<Highlight theme="tips">

  Don't forget to add the `aria-label` attribute on the `mc-fileuploader__input`

</Highlight>

## Display uploaded files and errors

Html and css does not provide a native way to achieve this, but using some Javascript, it is possible to display errors and uploaded files to the user.

Inside the file uploader, right after the `label`, add a list of files :

```Html
<div class="mc-fileuploader">
    <-- button and label here --!>
    <ul class="mc-fileuploader__files">
        <li class="mc-fileuploader__file mc-fileuploader__file--is-valid">
            <span class="mc-fileuploader__file-name">filename-valid.jpg</span>
            <span class="mc-fileuploader__file-icon"></span>
            <button type="button" class="mc-fileuploader__delete"></button>
        </li>
        <li class="mc-fileuploader__file mc-fileuploader__file--is-invalid">
            <span class="mc-fileuploader__file-name">filename-invalid.jpg</span>
            <span class="mc-fileuploader__file-icon"></span>
            <button type="button" class="mc-fileuploader__delete"></button>
            <div class="mc-fileuploader__file-message">
                Oops, the file "filename-invalid.jpg" was not uploaded. please try again
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

<Preview path="file-uploader-with-file-delete" />
