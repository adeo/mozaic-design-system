> A link is a component used exclusively to navigate to internal or external webpages or to anchors in the current page.

Please use a [button](/components/buttons/) for any other action.

By default, all the links are black `$color-grey-900`.

You should consider using the default link before thinking to any other color option, but occasionally, you can override the color depending on the context, for example on a dark background, or a link in an error box.

### Contextual links

Links, while generally are dark by default, have contextual variations that you can use occasionally depending on the need.

<Story id="action-link--default" />

<br />

| Color scheme | Usage                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Light        | Used when the background is dark |
| Primary      | Highlight important link         |
| Danger       | Highlight link to error content  |

## The inline link :

Inline links are links contained into paragraphs of text. By default, the inline links inherit the current size.

## The navigation links :

Single links are interface elements used to navigate between pages like :

- previous / next
- paginations
- text anchors
- breadcrumbs
- etc

### In this case we use two sizes

| size       | value               |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| **small**  | size.font.04 (14px) |
| **medium** | size.font.05 (16px) |

<Story id="action-link--sizes" />

### Displaying links with icons

In the link component, you can also add icons :
_Exclusively use a `16px` icon variant in links, the icon will be resized automaticaly depending on the font-size_

<Story id="action-link--with-icon-right" />

## Do's and Don'ts

<HintItem>Links should be underlined, and react to hover and click.</HintItem>

<HintItem>Use links only for navigation.</HintItem>

<HintItem>
  Always use the <b>16px icon</b> with the links.
  <br />
</HintItem>

<Hint
  type="do"
  title="Use inline links inside a paragraph, and navigation links outside."
>
  <Story id="action-link--dont" />
</Hint>

<HintItem dont>
    Don't use links for the others actions like showing an additional content. Please use a button instead.

</HintItem>

<HintItem dont>Never use the single link inside a paragraph.</HintItem>
