## Overview

![Select-Overview](Select-Overview.png)

Selects are a combination of the following mentions. Please note that you can use four different cases:
  - Label only + input
  - Label + requirement + input
  - Label + requirement + help text + input
  - Label + help text + input
  - Input only

### Label

The label helps the user to understand what information is needed in the select.

### Requirement

This mention allows to specify that this information is mandatory for the select to be valid.

  Please note that this mention can also be used to say a specific select is **optional** when the other ones are mandatory.

### Help text

Help text corresponds to a relevant piece of information to make sure the user understands what is needed.

### Input only

In specific use cases, you can use a select without label. For example to sort items in page list or search engine result page.

## Validation

There are two different elements for validation feedback:
  - The color of the input outline.
  - A text under the input explains what's wrong with the data entered.

## Sizes

You can use two different sizes to answer different needs. You can use both cases to suit your interface the best. Just keep in mind touch devices when placing smaller elements near each other.

  Never use different select sizes together.
