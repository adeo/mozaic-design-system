## Basic implementation

### Import

Import **the settings** and **the file uploader** `scss` files.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';

@import 'components/_c.file-uploader';
```

### Basic usage

> Natively, to upload files we use an `<input type="file" />`, but in Mozaic, we will customize it with a `<label>` that will act as a button.

Wrap a input[type="file"] and a label inside a div and apply the following classes :

```html
<div class="mc-fileuploader">
  <input type="file" class="mc-fileuploader__input" id="import-file-id1" />
  <label for="import-file-id1" class="mc-fileuploader__label">
    <span class="mc-fileuploader__label--center">
      Select a file to upload
    </span>
  </label>
</div>
```

<Story id="form-fileuploader--default" />

### Behaviors

#### Multiple files

You can choose to upload **several files at the same time** by adding the `multiple` attribute to your `input` element.

<Story id="form-fileuploader--with-attribute-multiple" />

#### Accept type of files

You can also restrict the type or the path of the file to be uploaded by using the `accept` attribute: `accept=".jpg, .jpeg, .png"` or `accept="image/*`.

<Story id="form-fileuploader--with-attribute-accept" />

#### Display uploaded files and errors

Html and css do not provide a native way to achieve this, but using some Javascript, it is possible to display errors and uploaded files to the user.

Inside the file uploader, right after the `label`, add a list of files :

```html
<div class="mc-fileuploader">
  <-- label and input here --!>
  <ul class="mc-fileuploader__files">
    <li class="mc-fileuploader__file mc-fileuploader__file--is-valid">
      <span class="mc-fileuploader__file-name">filename-valid.jpg</span>
      <span class="mc-fileuploader__file-icon"></span>
      <button type="button" class="mc-fileuploader__delete"></button>
    </li>
    <li class="mc-fileuploader__file mc-fileuploader__file--is-invalid">
      <span class="mc-fileuploader__file-name">filename-invalid.jpg</span>
      <span class="mc-fileuploader__file-icon"></span>
      <button type="button" class="mc-fileuploader__delete"></button>
      <div class="mc-fileuploader__file-message">
        Oops, the file "filename-invalid.jpg" was not uploaded. please try again
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

<Story id="form-fileuploader--with-errors" height="300" />

## Use in a form field

### Import

Import **the settings**, **the file uploader** and **the fields** scss files.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';

@import 'components/_c.file-uploader';

@import 'components/_c.fields';
```

> Note that the import order is important to get the right rendering of the component.

### Usage

When using the file uploader as part of a form, you must make sure to respect the following structure:

```html
<div class="mc-field">
  <label class="mc-field__label" for="default"> Label </label>

  <div class="mc-field__element mc-fileuploader">
    <input type="file" class="mc-fileuploader__input" id="default" />
    <label for="default" class="mc-fileuploader__label">
      <span class="mc-fileuploader__label--center">
        Select a file to upload
      </span>
    </label>
  </div>
</div>
```

<Story id="form-fileuploader--default" />

### Behaviors

#### Help text

You have the option of defining a help text for the user if necessary.

For this you have to add a span with the `mc-field__help` class below the label.

```html
<label class="mc-field__label"> Label </label>
<span class="mc-field__help"> Help text </span>
```

<Story id="form-fileuploader--with-help-text" />

#### Requirement

When the file uploader is mandatory, you must specify it to the user.

For this you have to add a span with the class `mc-field__requirement` right after the label text.

```html
<label class="mc-field__label">
  Label
  <span class="mc-field__requirement"> mandatory </span>
</label>
```

<Highlight type="tips" title="Semantic rule">

When the file uploader is mandatory the `required` attribute must be added on the `mc-fileuploader__input` element

</Highlight>

<Story id="form-fileuploader--with-requirement-text" />

### Validation

#### Invalid

To indicate that your file uploader is not valid, several steps are to be implemented:

- Add the `is-invalid` class and the `aria-invalid` attribute to the `mc-fileuploader__input` element
- You can add in addition a text detailing the error. This text must be added in a **span** with the class `mc-field__error-message` and positioned below the `mc-field__element` element

<Highlight type="tips" title="Accessibility rules">

If you use an error message you must comply with the following accessibility rules:

- the span `mc-field__error-message` must always have an `id`
- the `aria-describedby` attribute must be added on the `mc-fileuploader__input` element and must refer to the id of the error message

</Highlight>

<Story id="form-fileuploader--invalid" />
