## Overview

<Highlight theme="warning">

  A radio button can't be used alone, it must be used within a group.

</Highlight>

![Radio-Overview](Radio-Overview.png)

Radio button group is a combination of the following mentions. Please note that you can use four different cases:
  - Group label + radio buttons
  - Group label + requirement + radio buttons
  - Group label + requirement + help text + radio buttons
  - Groupe label + help text + radio buttons

### Label group

The label group helps the user to understand which radio to check.

  Please note that this mention can also be used to say a specific input is **optional** when the other ones are mandatory.
