## Import

Import the **settings** and the **text-input** `scss` files.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/_all-settings';

@include import-font-families();

@import 'components/_c.text-input';
```

## Basic usage

The easiest way to implement a date picker on a form field is to use the `type="date"` attribute on your `input` element.

In addition, the `input` element must also have the `mc-text-input` class.

```html
<input type="date" class="mc-text-input" placeholder="Empty" name="example" />
```

<Highlight theme="warning" title="date picker appearance">

  Using the `type="date"` attribute on an `input` element triggers the automatic generation of a date picker by the browser. The appearance of this date picker will therefore depend on the browser used.

  To solve this problem, you will have to implement a JavaScript library of your choice (see below "Custom date picker").

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Browser support">

  The `type="date"` attribute is an HTML5 feature that some browsers [do not support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=input-datetime).

  Indeed, for **Safari**, or **IE<11** browsers, using the `type="date"` attribute will have no effect, and will not generate a native datepicker.

  For these browsers, you will therefore have to use a Javascript library.

## Custom usage

The use of the `type="date"` attribute creates a concern for consistency in the appearance of the date picker, as explained above. The way to solve this problem is to :

**1. Using a `type="text"` attribute on your `input` element**

```html
<input type="texte" class="mc-text-input" placeholder="Empty" name="example" />
```

**2. Use a JavaScript library of your choice**

There are several JavaScript libraries on the market that allow you to implement a custom date picker that works consistently across all browsers.

## Variations

You can use any of the existing text-input component variations.

Read the [Text input component documentation](/Components/Form/TextInput/code/#available-sizes) for more information.

## Behaviors

The states applicable to the date picker are identical to those applicable to the text-input component.

Read the [Text input component documentation](/Components/Form/TextInput/code/#behaviors) for more information.

## Form validation & Accessibility

The date picker component complies with the same validation and accessibility rules as the text-input component.

Read the [Text input component documentation](/Components/Form/TextInput/code/#form-validation) for more information.
