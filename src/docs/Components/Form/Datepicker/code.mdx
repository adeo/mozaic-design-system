## Import

Import the **settings**, the **text-input** and the **field** `scss` files.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/_all-settings';

@include import-font-families();

@import 'components/_c.text-input';

@import 'components/_c.fields';
```

## Usage

The easiest way to implement a date picker on a form field is to apply the following elements:

- add the `mc-field` class on a html **div** element
- add the `mc-field__label` class on a **label** element
- add the `mc-field__input`class in addition of the `mc-text-input` class on an **input** element
- use the `type="date"` attribute on your **input** element

```html
<div class="mc-field">
  <label class="mc-field__label" for="example">
    Label
  </label>

  <input
    type="date"
    class="mc-text-input mc-field__input"
    id="example"
    name="example"
  />
</div>
```

  Using the `type="date"` attribute on an `input` element triggers the automatic generation of a date picker by the browser. The appearance and overall features of this date picker will therefore depend on the browser used.

  To have advanced control over appearance and features, you will have to use a JavaScript library for that (see below "[Custom usage](/Components/Form/Datepicker/code/#custom-usage)").

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Browser support">

  The `type="date"` attribute is an HTML5 feature that some browsers [do not support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=input-datetime).

  Indeed, for **Safari**, or **IE<11** browsers, using the `type="date"` attribute will have no effect, and will not generate a native datepicker.

  For these browsers, you will therefore have to use a Javascript library.

### Variations

You may use all existing text-input component variations.

Read the [Text input component documentation](/Components/Form/TextInput/code/#available-sizes) for more information.

### Behaviors

The states applicable to the date picker are identical to those applicable to the text-input component.

Read the [Text input component documentation](/Components/Form/TextInput/code/#behaviors) for more information.

## Custom usage

The use of the `type="date"` attribute creates a concern for consistency in the appearance and feature of the date picker, as explained above. The way to solve this problem is to:

**1. Using a `type="text"` attribute on your `input` element**

```html
<input type="text" class="mc-text-input mc-field__input" id="example" name="example" />
```

**2. Use a JavaScript library of your choice**

There are several JavaScript libraries on the market that allow you to implement a custom date picker that works consistently across all browsers.
