![Checkbox-Overview](Checkbox-Overview.png)

Checkbox group is a combination of the following mentions. Please note that you can use four different cases:
  - Group label + checkbox-es
  - Group label + requirement + checkbox-es
  - Group label + requirement + help text + checkbox-es
  - Groupe label + help text + checkbox-es

### Group label

The label group helps the user to understand which box-es to check.

  Please note that this mention can also be used to say a specific input is **optional** when the other ones are mandatory.
