## Overview

![QuantitySelector](QtySelector-Overview.png)

Quantity Selector is a combination of the following mentions:

- Label + incremental buttons + quantity field

## Usage

This type of input is best used when the user needs to choose the quantity of a selected item, like a product before adding to cart for example.

<Highlight theme="tips">

  Dont forget that the user can use its keyboard or the incremental buttons to select the quantity.

</Highlight>

## Variations

We provide two different sizes to adapt to your design needs but keep in mind that the `medium` case must be used on smaller breakpoints. More on [accessbility](Components/Form/QuantitySelector/accessibility/) page.

You can also require a minimal value from the user. In this case please use a greyed out minus button for the incremental button.

### Label

You can use quantity selectors with or without label depending on the context of the page where you are using it.

## Do & dont's

<HintItem dont>
  Never use quantity selector when the user needs to choose a date.
