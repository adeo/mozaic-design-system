## Overview

![QuantitySelector](QtySelector-Overview.png)

Quantity Selector is a combination of the following mentions:

- Label (optional)
- Incremental buttons + quantity field

## Sizes

We provide two different sizes to adapt to your design needs but keep in mind that the `medium` case must be used on smaller breakpoints. More on [accessibility](Components/Form/QuantitySelector/accessibility/) page.
