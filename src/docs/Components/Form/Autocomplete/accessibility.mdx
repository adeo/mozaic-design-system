[Complete guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/combobox/combobox-autocomplete-both.html)

`Enter`: Open or close the listbox component 

`Down Arrow`: 
- If the text-input is not empty and the listbox is displayed, moves visual focus to the first suggested value.
- If the textbox is empty and the listbox is not displayed, opens the listbox and moves visual focus to the first option.
- In both cases DOM focus remains on the text-input


`Up Arrow`:
- If the text-input is not empty and the listbox is displayed, moves visual focus to the last suggested value.
- If the text-input is empty, first opens the listbox if it is not already displayed and then moves visual focus to the last option.
- In both cases DOM focus remains on the text-input.
