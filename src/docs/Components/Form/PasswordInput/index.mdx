## Overview

![Password-Overview](Password-Overview.png)

Password input is a combination of the following mentions:

- A label (optional)
- An input text
- A reveal button to show and hide the password

## Behaviour

![Password-Overview](Password-RevealButton.png)

Make typos on mobile devices is common. To optimise the user journey & experience, the input is available with a feature that shows the password and avoid frustrations with sophisticated passwords.

For accessibility reasons, we preferred a text version instead of an eye icon.
