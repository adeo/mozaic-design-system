> With Segmented control component, users are able to switch from one view to another for the same data or information set.  
A view is therefore a different display format. For example, it can be a question of switching from a grid view to a list view, or between different period formats: daily, monthly, annual.

## Variations

### Sizes

The component is available in 2 different heights.

| Variation        | Height |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| S                | 32px   |
| M                | 48px   |

These variations in size ensure consistency with other elements of the interface.  
Indeed, make your choice according to the variation chosen for the other components like buttons or inputs.

### Options

Based on the most frequent uses, the component is available with 2 or 3 options.
An option corresponds to a view.

### Padding
Padding can be based on option labels or set automatically according to the needed alignment.
