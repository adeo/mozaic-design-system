## Variations

### Sizes

The component is available in two different sizes.

| Variation | Height     |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Small     | 2mu (32px) |
| Medium    | 3mu (48px) |

These variations ensure consistency with other elements of the interface. Please, make choices according to the variation chosen for the other components, such as buttons or inputs.

  yet developed.

## How to use

Uses of Segmented control are quite different from Filter, [Toggle](/Components/Form/Toggle/) and [Tabs](/Components/Tabs/).  
Please use one of these components when users need to filter, take binary actions or navigate.
