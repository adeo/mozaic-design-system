## Variations

### Sizes

The component is available in two different sizes.

| Variation | Height     |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Small     | 2mu (32px) |
| Medium    | 3mu (48px) |

These variations ensure consistency with other elements of the interface. Please, make choices according to the variation chosen for the other components, such as buttons or inputs.

### Segments

The component is available with two or three segments. Each of them corresponds to a view.

## Behaviours

### Width

Depending on the layout, the width of the Segmented control can fit its content or container.

### Selection

Only one segment can be active at a time. Layout or format must change instantly when a segment is selected.

## States

<Highlight type="tips" title="Good to know">
  Segments can't be disabled. Avoid using the segmented control if a view isn't
  yet developed.
</Highlight>

## How to use

Uses of Segmented control are quite different from Filter, [Toggle](/components/form/toggle/) and [Tabs](/components/tabs/).  
Please use one of these components when users need to filter, take binary actions or navigate.
