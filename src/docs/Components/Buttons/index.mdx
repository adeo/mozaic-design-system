> Buttons are used to **trigger actions**. Their appearance is depending on the type of action required from the user, or the context.

## Variations

We created different color themes to suit what you need in your design.
You can use `primary` (default), `neutral` and `danger` theme in `solid` and `bordered` declination. These declinations can help you to make what's important stand out.
