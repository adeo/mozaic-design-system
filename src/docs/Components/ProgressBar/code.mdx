## Import

```scss
@import "settings-tools/_all-settings";

@import "components/_c.progressbar";
```

## Usage

The code of the **ProgressBar** component is structured as follows:

- A global div with the class: `mc-progressbar`.
- An inner div with the class: `mc-progressbar__indicator`.
- A div element indicating in a textual way the value of the current percentage with the class: `mc-progressbar__percentage`.

```html
<div class="mc-progressbar">
  <div
    class="mc-progressbar__indicator"
    role="progressbar"
    aria-valuenow="25"
    aria-valuemin="0"
    aria-valuemax="100"
    style="width: 25%;"
  >
    &nbsp;
  </div>
  <div class="mc-progressbar__percentage">25%</div>
</div>
```

<Highlight theme="info" title="Good to know">
The <code class="dtEPZw">mc-progressbar__indicator</code> div must always be present in your code to ensure a good level of accessibility to the component.

Note however that by default this element will be visually hidden.

However, you have the possibility to make this element visible if needed ([read more about this above](/Components/ProgressBar/code/#percentage-progress)).

</Highlight>

<Highlight theme="tips" title="The style attribute">

The `style` attribute on the `mc-progressbar__indicator` element allows you to manage the width of the progress indicator by updating the `width` property in real time as the load progresses.

</Highlight>

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Accessibility rules">

As you can see from the code above, many **aria attributes** are on the `mc-progressbar__indicator` element.

Some of these attributes are mandatory and must always appear in your code in order to comply with accessibility rules.

We recommend that you [read the page dedicated to the accessibility of this component](/Components/ProgressBar/accessibilty/) in order to learn more.

## Variations

### Color themes

The **ProgressBar** component is supplied with two color variations:

- **the default variation**: this version is the one that best meets the web accessibility criteria and that we recommend you to use as much as possible.
- **the brand variation**: this version is the one that embraces the **Leroy Merlin** brand identity. To use this variation, simply apply the `mc-progressbar--branded` modifier to the `mc-progressbar` element.

<Preview path="variations-colors" />

### Sizes

You can create your **ProgressBar** component using one of the two following size formats:

- **extra small**: by adding the `mc-progressbar--xs` modifier to the `mc-progressbar` element.
- **small**: by adding the `mc-progressbar--s` modifier to the `mc-progressbar` element.
- **medium**: this is the default format, therefore it does not need to add a modifier.

### Percentage progress

In some cases, it may be necessary to explicitly show to the user the percentage change in the progress bar.

To do this, you can add the `mc-progressbar--percent` modifier to the `mc-progressbar` element.

<Preview path="percentage" />

> Note that the height of the component changes to **24px** when using the `mc-progressbar--percent` modifier, in order to allow the optimal display of the percentage.

#### The mc-progressbar--half modifier

In order to respect the accessibility criteria, the color of the percentage text must be updated according to the position of the progress bar.

So when the percentage value is 51% or more, please apply the `mc-progressbar--half` modification to your component.
