## Variations

### Linear progress

Linear progress embodies the idea of clearing a path. It can be used during long surveys to visually materialise the progress of the user in a particular journey. The linear progress bar is made of two distinctive elements:
  - track: symbolised by a grey bar to demonstrate the path that still has to be made.
  - progress: embodies the progress the user has made so far.

#### Default version

This version is the most accessible version of this pattern. We used `$color-info-600` color to illustrate the informative goal of this progress bar.

#### Branded version

Because Mozaic is mainly used in LEROY MERLIN context we also provide a color branded version of the progress bar **but you have to keep in mind that this version is the least accessible and that it doesn't pass AA standards**.

### Percentage progress

The percentage progress bar version is used when you need to tell the exact progression the user has made. This version has the same track and progress elements with the percentage number centered.
