> The Built-in menu is a useful component for creating a sub-navigation within a content page.  
Unlike the [Segmented control](/Components/SegmentedControl/), this menu has no comparative function and allows users to move seamlessly from one type of content to another, all closely related and located on the same page.  
As a sub-level of navigation, it follows the main and tab navigation in the page hierarchy. It keeps users engaged while adding a new level of navigation to the overall content experience.

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Work in progress">
    Please, note that the Built-in menu is a beta component and it will be improved
  through the following sprints.
