## Behaviours

### Responsive

The Page header is a flexible element that fills the container's width. It must start on the left-hand edge or next to the Sidebar component.

<Highlight type="warning" title="Be aware">

Please note that the margins of the Page header depend on the container's width.

</Highlight>

### Breakpoints

For the moment, the Page header component has been designed for desktop devices, from breakpoints `L` to `XXL`.

### Content

As a component with a cross-functional purpose independent of page content, none of its elements can be disabled. If a feature is not available, it must not be displayed.

## Restrictions

The height of the Page header only depends on its configuration and can't be custom-tailored or modified.

## Layout

The Page header is always displayed above the page content and can be optionally fixed or not while scrolling. In the second case, it can appear when users scroll back to the top of the page.
