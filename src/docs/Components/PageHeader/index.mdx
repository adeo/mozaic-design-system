## Behaviours

Page Header component is typically located at the top of the page container and takes on the full weight of the container. As a result, its external margins depend on the breakpoint values of the container. If it is not located within the page container, it is still strongly related to it.  
Currently, this component is only available for breakpoints L to XXL or at a minimum width of 960px when used with the [Sidebar component](/Components/Sidebar/).  
His height depends of elements and their configuration inside.
