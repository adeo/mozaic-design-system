## Four Tags types for different usages

### Text tags

Text tags are used to display product or service properties with no related page or category, they are not interactive elements.

### Link tags

Link tags are a variation of the text tags, they have the same appearance but they are **used as a link**. For example to redirect user to a category page.

### Selectable tags

Selectable tags are used to select (or deselect) values from a proposal of multiple keywords. They are a good alternative to radio buttons, checkboxes or toggle buttons when you need to select values **outside a form**.

## There are two sizes for tags to create hierarchy and for a better adaptability

| Size   | Height value  |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Small  | 1.5 mu (24px) |
| Medium | 2 mu (32px)   |

Small tags should only be used on desktop.

## Spacing in tags list

Tags are mainly used in list. The spacings between each of them must be 1 mu (16px), horizontally and vertically.
