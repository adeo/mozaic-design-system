# Variations

## Color themes

Every breadcrumb size variation is available both in light and dark version. This allows you to adapt the breadcrumb to the background of your designs.

## Breakpoint behaviours

### Smaller breakpoints

Breadcrumb can't be fully displayed on smaller breakpoints, that is why this version allows you to go back on the previous level only.

--small breadcrumb preview--

### Medium and larger breakpoints

For medium and larger breakpoints, you can display the whole path of the current page. We used some links to inform the user that the breadcrumb is clickable.
