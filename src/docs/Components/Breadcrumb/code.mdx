## Basic implementation

### Import

Import **the settings**, **the link** and **the breadcrumb** scss files.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/_all-settings';

@include import-font-families();

@import 'components/_c.links';

@import 'components/_c.breadcrumb';
```

### Usage

You can create breadcrumbs in the following way:

- Use the `mc-breadcrumb` class on an HTML element `<nav>` as a wrapper
- Apply the `mc-breadcrumb__container` class to the `<ul>` container of your breadcrumb
- The `<li>` elements must have the class `mc-breadcrumb__item`
- Each link must have the class `mc-link`
- In addition to the `mc-link` class, add the class `mc-breadcrumb__current` on the last level link

```html
<nav class="mc-breadcrumb" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
  <ul class="mc-breadcrumb__container">
    <li class="mc-breadcrumb__item">
      <a href="#" class="mc-link">
        Level 00
      </a>
    </li>
    <li class="mc-breadcrumb__item">
      <span class="mc-link mc-breadcrumb__current">
        Level 01
      </span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

> Note that for all behaviors related to breadcrumb links, please refer to the [Links pattern documentation](/Components/Links/code/).

## Variations

### Color themes

The breadcrumb is available in two colour variations.

You can use these variations by applying the following modifiers:

- **Light mode**: this is the default variation so you don't need to add a modifier
- **Dark mode**: use the `mc-breadcrumb--dark` modifier

#### About the dark mode

In addition to the `mc-breadcrumb--dark` modifier to use on the wrapper, you must also use the `mc-link--light` modifier on the links.

> You can learn more about how this works in the [Links pattern documentation](/Components/Links/code/).

## Behaviours

### Smaller breakpoints

As explained on [the main page](/Components/Breadcrumb/#smaller-breakpoints), the breadcrumb can't be displayed entirely on lower resolutions.

That's why you must make sure to display **only** the previous level link of the current page on these resolutions.

```html
<nav class="mc-breadcrumb" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
  <ul class="mc-breadcrumb__container">
    <li class="mc-breadcrumb__item">
      <a href="#" class="mc-link mc-breadcrumb__current">
        Level
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

If you don't have the possibility to perform tests allowing you to display only the previous level link, we provide you with a way to achieve the desired functioning in pure HTML & CSS:

- Add the `mc-breadcrumb--responsive` modifier to the wrapper
- Add the `is-active` class on the last `<li>` level

```html
<nav class="mc-breadcrumb mc-breadcrumb--responsive" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
  <ul class="mc-breadcrumb__container">
    <li class="mc-breadcrumb__item">
      <a href="#" class="mc-link">
        Level 00
      </a>
    </li>
    <li class="mc-breadcrumb__item">
      <a href="#" class="mc-link">
        Level 01
      </a>
    </li>
    <li class="mc-breadcrumb__item is-active">
      <span class="mc-link mc-breadcrumb__current">
        Level 02
      </span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

## Semantic

<HintItem>
  The breadcrumb being a navigation element, we recommend you use a{' '}
  <strong>nav</strong> tag as its global wrapper.
</HintItem>
<HintItem>
  An HTML structure with <strong>ul</strong> and <strong>li</strong> elements is
  recommended inside your global wrapper.
