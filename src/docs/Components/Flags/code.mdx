## Import

Import the settings and the flag `scss` files.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';
@import 'components/_c.flag';
```

## Basic usage

To create a flag you have one main class to apply `mc-flag`, and wrap the text inside the flag in a `span.mc-flag__label`. While the text without span will look mostly fine, we use it to opticaly align the characters baseline in the flag.

```html
<div class="mc-flag">Flag label</div>
```

<Preview path="flag-default" />

## Variations

### Available themes

- `solid`
- `bordered`
- `solid-primary-02` (no longer maintened)
- `bordered-primary-02` (no longer maintened)
- `solid-dark`
- `bordered-dark`
- `solid-light`
- `bordered-light`
- `solid-danger`
- `bordered-danger`

example :

```html
<div class="mc-flag">Flag flag__label</div>

<div class="mc-flag mc-flag--bordered-primary-02">Flag bordered primary 02</div>
```

#### Solid

<Preview path="flag-solid" />

#### Bordered

<Preview path="flag-bordered" />

### Multi-line flag

<Highlight theme="warning">

By default, the flag component can't extend over several lines.

Indeed, as indicated in the [Do's and Dont's](/Components/Flags/#dos-and-donts) section of the documentation, it is not allowed to use too long text inside your flag.

</Highlight>

However in rare exceptions where you don't have the possibility to make your content fit on a single line we provide you with the `mc-flag--extend` modifier which allows you to get a multi-line flag.

## Customization and mixins

### The set-flag-theme mixin

In case you need to create a new flag theme you'll need to define a new SASS map, see below :

```scss
$my-map: (
  'color-theme': (
    'background': white,
    'border': blue 'text': red,
  ),
);
```

Once the map of your theme is defined you can use the mixin `set-flag-theme`.

```scss
.mc-flag--my-custom-theme {
  @include set-flag-theme($my-map);
}
```

Then, it will generate something like this :

```scss
.mc-flag--my-custom-theme {
  color: red;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  background-color: white;
}
```
