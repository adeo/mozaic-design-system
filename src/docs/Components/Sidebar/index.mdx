> The Sidebar component is the vertical navigation element commonly used in digital products to provide users with quick and easy access to top-level features.  
It is designed to save space and keep the focus on features and business gestures.  
It is combined with the [Page header component](/Components/PageHeader/) to clearly structure the user experience in our digital products and portals.

## Variations

### Anatomy

Sidebar component consists of the following elements:

| Element | Purpose | Notes |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| **Expand/collapse button** | Allows the user to collapse or expand the sidebar | Ghost button with DoubleArrowRight icon, always displayed. No scroll. |
| **Home button** | Allows the user to access directly to the product or portal homepage | Optional ghost button. The "Home" icon is not editable, the label can be changed. No scroll. |
| **Sections: features** | Provides access to different features of the product or portal | Always displayed. Scroll when list of features exceeds display container. |
| **Sections: utilities** | Allows access to transversal functionalities of the product | Optional |
| **User menu** | Allows the user to access their account-related features | Optional |

### Levels

The Sidebar offer possibility to set 2 levels.  
First level is mandatory and displayed by default.
The second level is displayed only if another level of navigation is needed and appears when clicking on a feature.  
These levels only impacts "Features" section.

### Sections: features

Features are grouped into feature groups working such as accordions.  
3 different types of features:
- default: the user accesses the feature within the portal
- external link: the feature is displayed in a new tab (display of the "External link" icon)
- non-accessible: the feature is not accessible (display of the "Lock" icon, the label is shaded)

A vertical scroll is possible if there is not enough space to display all the items.
On second level, display of the feature label with an arrow to return to the 1st level.
On two levels, a vertical scroll is possible if there is not enough space to display all the items.

### Sections: utilities

Allows access to transversal functionalities of the product.
An icon is dedicated to each functionality.
Note this section always hangs on the user's menu (in its closed version).

### User menu

This menu allows the user to access features related to his account, such as his profile, the interface language or logout.  
The User menu is always sticky at the bottom of the component, closed by default, and opens with a click on the Control/More icon.  
When open, its height is relative, based on the number of items. The menu opens above the other sections of the Sidebar.  
Closed, its height is fixed, and it closes with a click on Control/Less icon. Closed, the user's name, role, and user picture are displayed. A default state (placeholder) is defined if there is no photo of the user.

## Behaviours

The Sidebar can be in 2 states: collapsed and expanded.  
Collapse is the default state, no labels are visible, only icons. When clicking on the Expand/collapse button, the Sidebar expands, and labels are displayed.
Note the Sidebar also expands when you click on another item and closes automatically when a feature is selected by user.

  Please remind that Sidebar expands over page container

## States

### Items

| State | Purpose | Values |
| ----- | ------- | ------ |
| Hover | Display a background behind the hovered item | background color = Secondary/Blue grey/700 |
| Active | Display a background behind the selected item | background color = Primary/600 |
| Focus | Display an outline of the width of the content | color = Status/Information/500, thickness = 1px |
| Disabled/locked | Label shaded | font color = Secondary/BlueGrey/400 |

## Restrictions

### Labels

Too long labels are cut off. We strongly recommend an average of 27 characters with a maximum limit of 55 characters.

### Consistency
To keep consistency, the [Page header](/Components/PageHeader/) name must be the same than the sidebar entry name.

## Layout

The Sidebar is outside the container, sticked to the left, top and bottom sides of the viewport.
  
By default, the sidebar extends over the container.  
The sidebar has a fixed width depending on its state:
- Collapsed = 64px
- Expanded = 320px

Its height is therefore always 100% of the viewport.

## Specific cases

### Utilities

The Utilities section can be hidden if not necessary.

### User picture

If a user has not uploaded a picture, a default placeholder should be used instead.

## How to use

To use the Sidebar component, add it to the left side of the screen, outside the container.
