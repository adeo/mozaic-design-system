A card is a navigation element that structures a group of related informations that must be understood on its own. It visually looks like a playing card.

A card is mostly a visualisation of the page that is to come behind the card herself.

## Usages

You will find two different cards versions. One is boxed, the other is not boxed.

### Boxed version

This version of the card is best for navigation and link elements between them throughout the user journey. For example, it's great to use to redirect the user to a specific category.

### Unboxed version

This version is more suited for informative content. It's best used at the end of a big page to redirect the user to an article for example.

## Anatomy

### Mandatory elements
