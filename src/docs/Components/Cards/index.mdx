> A card is a graphic element that structures a group of related informations that must be understood on its own. It visually looks like a playing card.

## Usages

A card is mostly a visualisation of the page that is to come behind the card itself.

### Outlined version

Outlined cards are used to avoid floating impressions, for example, when you create parallax or depth effects with different card sizes.

<Highlight theme="tips" title="Good to know">

This version is best used when you don't have too many cards to display.

</Highlight>

### Unboxed version

The unboxed version is best used when you have a large amount of cards to display to avoid graphic complexity due to the repetition of the outline.

## Anatomy

![CardsAnatomy--Mandatory](CardsAnatomy--Mandatory.png)

A card must have some distinctive elements to be recognizable and understood on its own:

- an image
- a title
- a subtitle (optional)
- a description text (optional)
- a card footer with actions (optional)

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Be careful">

A description text is optional, but it's recommanded to display this element for a better understanding.

</Highlight>

## Actions

Using an action can facilitate a good comprehension of the most complex cards.

### Link

A link is used when the user needs to go on another page.
