## Import

Import **the settings** and **the card** scss files.

In addition to the basic files listed above, you must also import the `_c.button.scss` or `_c.links` file, when you use a button or link inside your card.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';

@import 'components/c.button'; // optional
@import 'components/c.links'; // optional
@import 'components/c.card';
```

## Usage

The creation of a **Card** component in your code is done using the following HTML structure:

```html
<div class="mc-card">
  <figure class="mc-card__visual">
    <img src="your-example-image.jpg" alt="" class="mc-card__img" />
  </figure>
  <article class="mc-card__content">
    <h1 class="mc-card__title">Card title</h1>
    <h2 class="mc-card__subtitle">There can be a subtitle here.</h2>
    <div class="mc-card__body">
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
        tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
      </p>
    </div>
    <footer class="mc-card__footer">
      <a href="#" class="mc-link mc-link--m">Default link</a>
    </footer>
  </article>
</div>
```

The **Card** component is composed of several elements, namely:

- an image
- a title
- a subtitle
- a description text
- a card footer with actions

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Mandatory elements">

Among these elements, please note that **the image and the title are mandatory**, and must **always appear** in your Card elements. The other elements are optional.

</Highlight>

<Highlight theme="info">

You are free to use the HTML tag of your choice for **the subtitle** element of the Card component. For **the title** element, we recommend that you use an **Hn title tag** whenever possible.

</Highlight>

## Variations

### Unboxed version

The unboxed version is best used when you have a large amount of cards to display to avoid graphic complexity due to the repetition of the outline.

<Story id="content-card--default" height="510" />

### Outlined version

Outlined cards are used to avoid floating impressions.

To define an outlined card, you must add the `mc-card--bordered` modifier to your `mc-card` element.

```html
<div class="mc-card mc-card--bordered">
  <!-- the card elements here -->
</div>
```

<Story id="content-card--boxed-card" height="510" />

### Card with link

You can use a link inside your card. A link is used when the user needs to go on another page.

When using a link in a card, you must make sure to perform the following scss imports:

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';

@import 'components/c.links';
@import 'components/c.card';
```

<Highlight theme="warning">

The link inserted in your card must be a Mozaic Link of **size M**.

Learn more by looking at [the documentation of the Mozaic Link](/Components/Links/code/#available-sizes).

</Highlight>

<Story id="content-card--card-with-link" height="510" />

### Card with button

You can also use a button inside your card. A button is used when the user can make an action on a card.

When using a button in a card, you must make sure to perform the following scss imports:

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';

@import 'components/c.button';
@import 'components/c.card';
```

<Highlight theme="warning">

The button inserted in your card must be a Mozaic Button of **size S**.

Learn more by looking at [the documentation of the Mozaic Button](/Components/Buttons/#sizes).

</Highlight>

<Story id="content-card--card-with-button" height="520" />

## Card image ratio

When creating your Card component, you can also define which image ratio should be applied to your component's visual.

For this you have the possibility to choose among the following image ratios, and to apply on your element `mc-card__visual` the associated css modifier:

| ratio    | modifier                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **1:1**  | `mc-card__visual--1x1`                 |
| **4:3**  | _(default ratio - no modifier needed)_ |
| **16:9** | `mc-card__visual--16x9`                |
