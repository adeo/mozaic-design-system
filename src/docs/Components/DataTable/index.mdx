> The Datatable is used to present a large set of data organised in rows and columns.  
By structuring data in this format, tables provide an intuitive and efficient way to browser and analyse complex amounts of information.  
In addition, DataTable has built-in paging, sorting and filtering features, making it a powerful tool.

## Structure

### Topbar

The topbar section allows users to edit, filter, set up or make actions.  
Each element of the topbar is optionnal, as the topbar itself.

#### Edition

Allow the user to interact with selected items.

#### Filter

| Feature           | Usage                                                   | Preview |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Toggle**        | Quick filter (max. 1)                                   |         |
| **Search input**  | Filter rows with keywords (Please be explicit for user) |         |
| **Filter button** | Open filters layer                                      |         |

##### Active filter

When filters are applied to the table, they are displayed between the topbar and the data content.  
To ensure visibility to the user and to allow easy removal, these filters are presented using [Removable tags] (/Components/Tag/#removable-tags).  
In addition, a reset button allows users to remove them all.

An empty state must be defined if there are no results.

#### Settings

Allow the user to set up the display of the datatable layout.

| Feature      | Usage                                                                                                        | Preview |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| **Settings** | Access to table edition like edit columns (reorder, show/hide) or change display density (size of the cells) |         |

#### Actions

| Feature                      | Preview |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| **Validation action**        |         |
| **Rejected/Negative action** |         |

Note that these actions relate to the data in the table.  
This can be useful for validating an item or adding a line. By default, two types of buttons are available:
- a primary solid button for main action
- a danger bordered button for negative action

These buttons can be customised, taking care to respect good UX practices and the uses defined in the design system.
For more global actions related to a process or a business gesture, it is recommended to use the bottom bar.

### Data content

#### Columns

The Datatable allows to display several types of data.  
To ensure optimal readability of the whole data set, it is strongly recommended to display only one data type per column.

| Data                                  | Usage                                                                                                                         | Width behaviour        |

#### Rows

In a table, a row corresponds to an item.  
The columns can then be used to list different types of data related to that particular object such as status, description or numeric values.  
A row must be selected with a checkbox, and each selected row turns to a different colour background to make it easier to read.

<!-- Add preview -->

Subrows provide more details of an item. They are therefore neither selectable nor editable as an object.

#### Labels

Labels are always at the top of the table and in capitals letters to differentiate them from the data.  
They can be fixed when scrolling.  
A checkbox at label level allows all rows to be selected.
As a common and usual practice, the reordering feature is located next to each label.

#### Mass selection

Mass selection is possible thanks to the checkbox at the level of the labels.  
First, all rows of the displayed page are selected. A banner appears giving the possibility to select all the rows of the table.  
When clicked, all rows of the table are selected. The banner is still displayed but this time it allows to clear the selection.

#### Empty state

As mentioned with the filters, an empty state must be defined if there are no results.  
The message can be edited to fit the context. It should be easily understood by the user, avoiding technical jargon for example.

### Footer

The DataTable footer is placed at the bottom of the component and contains the elements that allow you to manage the navigation and pagination of the table.  
As it is impossible to know 100% how many rows will be displayed, it is strongly recommended to always display the footer.

| Feature                                   | Usage                                                 | Preview |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| ** Rows's number selector**               | Allow to choose the number of row to display          |         |
| **Displayed rows indicator**              | Display the page's rows and the total number of rows  |         |
| [**Pagination**](/Components/Pagination/) | Allow to navigate to the other pages of the datatable |         |

## Variations

### Sizes

Each cells are available in 3 sizes.

| Size             | Value        |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Small            | 2.5mu (40px) |
| Medium (default) | 3mu (48px)   |
| Large            | 3.5mu (56px) |

## Layout

In order to avoid double scrolling, we recommend 2 ways of defining the height of the datatable: either by the size of the viewport, or by the number of rows displayed.

##### By the size of the viewport
![TableLayout--Fill](TableLayout--Fill.png)

##### By the number of rows displayed
![TableLayout--Fixed](TableLayout--Fixed.png)
