## Import

Import the settings and the option-card `scss` files for the option card component.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/_all-settings';
@import '_c.option-card'; // mandatory
@import 'components/_c.checkbox'; // import when using a option-card "multiple option"
@import 'components/_c.radio'; // import when using a option-card "single option"
```

## Usage

The creation of an option card component in your code is done using the following HTML structure:

```HTML
  <div class="mc-option-card">
    <input
      type="radio"
      name="option-group"
      id="radio-01"
      class="mc-radio__input mc-option-card__input"
      />
    <label for="radio-01" class="mc-option-card__label"></label>
    <div class="mc-option-card__content">
      <!-- Here your content -->
    </div>
  </div>
```

## Implement as a group

In order to group and organize a list of `option-card` you must wrap them in a HTML element using `mc-option-group` class.

This class has to be define in the user environment. In fact we let the end-user choose the layout that suit their needs.
For example, you can use it with flexbox.

```scss
  .mc-option-group {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between | space-evenly;
    ...
  }
```

## Variations

### Single option

In order to use the option-card with a single option, you must use radio buttons inside the component.

<Preview path="default" />

### Multi options

In order to use the option-card with multi choices, you must use checkboxes inside the component.

<Preview path="checkbox" />

### Centered

In some cases, the radio or the checkbox has to be centered.

To achieve that you have to add `mc-option-card--centered` modifier to the `mc-option-card` element.

<Preview path="centered" />

### Padding

In some cases, the radio or the checkbox needs a smaller padding.

To achieve that you have to add `mc-option-card--small` modifier to the `mc-option-card` element.

## Content

All your content must go inside the `.mc-option-card__content` element.
The content container is fluid, it means that the user content will shape the card aspect.

### Padding

By default, the content has a padding of 16px.

#### Small

In some cases, your content will need a smaller padding.

To achieve that you have to add `mc-option-card--small` modifier to the `mc-option-card` element.

#### No padding

In some cases, your content need to fill the whole card. To add an image for example.

To achieve that you have to add `mc-option-card--no-padding` modifier to the `mc-option-card` element.
