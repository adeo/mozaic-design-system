## Variations

We use two different types of tab navigation depending on the device.

### Tab navigation

This is the default behaviour for a tab navigation. This pattern can be used on every breakpoint but you have to keep in mind that the user will have to swipe on the tab bar when it doesn't fit on screen.

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Important notice">

Please note that you must insert the layer `ðŸ›  Toolkit/01-Background/03-Banner` as a background of every tab bar you create.

</Highlight>

### Dropdown navigation

This navigation must be used when the device is not swipe compatible.

## Do & dont's

<HintItem>A tab bar must always have at least an active and an inactive tab.</HintItem>
<HintItem dont>
  Never use more than one active tab on a tab bar.
</HintItem>
