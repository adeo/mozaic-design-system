> Tabs allow the user to navigate from a content to another within the same context. It keeps the user on the same page.

## Variations

<Highlight theme="tips" title="Good to know">

This is the default behaviour for a tab navigation. This pattern can be used on every breakpoint but you have to keep in mind that the user will have to swipe on the tab bar when it doesn't fit on screen.

</Highlight>

Tabs can have two different alignments depending on the context you are using this pattern. You will be able to left align the tab bar to a container or center the tab bar on the full page width.

### Aligned to a container

  Please know that your tab labels must be concise to be easily readable by the user and describe what is contained.

## Specific behaviour

### Dropdown navigation

This navigation must be used when the device is not swipe compatible.
