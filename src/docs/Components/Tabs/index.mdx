> Tabs allow the user to navigate from a content to another within the same context. It keeps the user on the same page.

## Variations

We use two different types of tab navigation depending on the device.

### Tab navigation

This is the default behaviour for a tab navigation. This pattern can be used on every breakpoint but you have to keep in mind that the user will have to swipe on the tab bar when it doesn't fit on screen.

#### Ready to use

You will find a `ReadyToUse` section in the Sketch file to help you quickly use the tab bar pattern. Please use these symbols if you don't want to create your own tab bar.

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Important notice">

Please note that you must insert the layer `ðŸ›  Toolkit/01-Background/03-Banner` as a background of every tab bar you create if you choose not to use the ready to use symnbols.

### Dropdown navigation

This navigation must be used when the device is not swipe compatible.
