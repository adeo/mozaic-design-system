> Tabs allow the user to navigate from a content to another within the same context. It keeps the user on the same page.

## Variations

We use two different types of tab navigation depending on the device.

### Tab navigation

This is the default behaviour for a tab navigation. This pattern can be used on every breakpoint but you have to keep in mind that the user will have to swipe on the tab bar when it doesn't fit on screen.

### Dropdown navigation

This navigation must be used when the device is not swipe compatible.
