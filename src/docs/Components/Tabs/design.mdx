#### Ready to use

You will find a `ReadyToUse` section in the Sketch file to help you quickly use the tab bar pattern. Please use these symbols if you don't want to create your own tab bar.

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Important notice">

Please note that you must insert the layer `ğŸ›  Toolkit/01-Background/03-Banner` as a background of every tab bar you create if you choose not to use the ready to use symbols.

</Highlight>
