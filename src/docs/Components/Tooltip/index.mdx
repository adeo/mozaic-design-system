## Usage

Please, follow these simple rules when using tooltips:

- A tooltip must be used near the highlighted content
- The tooltip text must be short (1 or 2 lines maximum)

## Variations

### Text tooltip (default)

The Text tooltip is an additional content used to define an unclear term.

### Icon tooltip

This kind of tooltip is displayed when a user needs more information, such as understanding an UI element's purpose. It is usually triggered with an informative icon placed near the UI element.

## Specific variation

### Without pointer

In less common cases, a tooltip should cover a large area and follow the mouse pointer. For example, on Dataviz elements like a slice of a Donut Chart.
