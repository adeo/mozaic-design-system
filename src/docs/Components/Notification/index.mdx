> Notifications are used to bring user's attention on an information he needs to know. A notification is usually the result of an action made by the user.

The notification pattern is made of :

- **An icon:** In addition to the frame color, it allows to specify the degree of importance.
- **A title _(optional)_:** Concise and precise, to quickly guide the user.
- **A paragraph:** To complete the title to be more precise, or indicate the actions to follow.
- **A Link _(optional)_**:** A link can be used when the message indicates the user actions to be done on a different page.

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Be aware">

For SEO & accessibility reasons, a paragraph is always required inside a notification.
