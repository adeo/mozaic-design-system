> Notifications are used to bring the user's attention on a piece of information that needs to be known. A notification is usually the result of an action made by the user.

The notification component is made of:

- **An icon:** In addition to the frame color, it allows to specify the degree of importance.
- **A title _(optional)_:** Concise and precise, to quickly guide the user.
- **A paragraph:** To complete the title to be more precise, or indicate the actions to follow.
- **One or some actions _(optional)_:** A link or button(s) can be used when users need to do an action.

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Be aware">

For SEO & accessibility reasons, a paragraph is always required inside a notification.
