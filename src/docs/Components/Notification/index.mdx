> Notifications are used to bring user's attention on an information he needs to know. There are four types of notifications. A notification is usually the result of an action made by the user.

The notification pattern is made of :

- **An icon :** In addition to the frame color, it allows to specify the degree of importance.
- **A title (optional):** Concise and precise, to quickly guide the user.
- **A paragraph (optional):** To complete the title to be more precise, or indicate the actions to follow.
- **A Link (optional):** A link can be used when the message indicates the user actions to be done on a different page.

> You can have a notification with a title only or a paragraph only but you must use at least one of them.
