## Behaviours

### Content

States should be easy to read and defined by a generic word. If you have to give more information, don't hesitate to accompany badges with icon tooltip or trigger a modal with components like a button, link, icon, etc.

## Do's and Don'ts

<HintItem>Always use a short label inside the badge.</HintItem>
<HintItem dont>
  Don't override the colours. They are defined by their status.
</HintItem>
<HintItem dont>
  Don't use several badges for the same element. It can only have one status.
</HintItem>
<HintItem dont>
  Never use a badge as a clickable element. A badge should be used to display
  status information.
