> A badge indicates the status of an entity and can evolve at any time.

## Types

The badge component is available in 5 states. Each state corresponds with a defined status.

| **Success**     | Validated, Online status                                                        |         |

## Behaviours

### Content

States should be easy to read and defined by a generic word. If you have to give more information, don't hesitate to accompany badges with icon tooltip or trigger a modal with components like a button, link, icon, etc.
