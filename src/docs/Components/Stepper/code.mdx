## Import

Import **the settings** and **the stepper** scss files.

```scss
@import "settings-tools/_all-settings";

@include import-font-families();

@import "components/_c.stepper";
```

## Usage

The **Stepper** is an ordered list HTML element, which must be embedded in a nav HTML element.

To implement the **Stepper** in your code, you must therefore use and respect the following HTML structure:

```html
<nav class="mc-stepper" aria-label="Stepper description">
  <ol class="mc-stepper__list">
    <li class="mc-stepper__item mc-stepper__item--current" aria-current="step">
      <span class="mc-stepper__indicator" aria-hidden="true">1</span>
      <div class="mc-stepper__detail">
        <span class="mc-stepper__title">Step 1 / 2</span>
        <span class="mc-stepper__label">Shopping cart</span>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mc-stepper__item">
      <span class="mc-stepper__indicator" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</span>
      <div class="mc-stepper__detail">
        <span class="mc-stepper__title">Step 2 / 2</span>
        <span class="mc-stepper__label">Shipping</span>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</nav>
```

## States

The stages within the **Stepper** can adopt **different visual states** to indicate to the users where they are in their journey.

These states are as follows:

- Pending validation _(default state - no modifier needeed)_
- Current step
- Validated step

### Current step

To indicate that a step is the current step, you must add the `mc-stepper__item--current` modifier to the concerned `.mc-stepper__item` element.

For accessibility reasons, you should also add the `aria-current="step"` attribute to indicate to screen readers the current step.

```html
<li class="mc-stepper__item mc-stepper__item--current" aria-current="step">
  <span class="mc-stepper__indicator" aria-hidden="true">1</span>
  <div class="mc-stepper__detail">
    <span class="mc-stepper__title">Step 1 / 2</span>
    <span class="mc-stepper__label">Shopping cart</span>
  </div>
</li>
```

<Highlight theme="info">

In its initial state, before the start of the user journey, the first step is by default always in the current state.

</Highlight>

<Highlight theme="warning">

A **Stepper** can have only one element that indicate the current state.

Please ensure that this rule is respected when implementing a **Stepper** in your code.

</Highlight>

### Validated step

All steps **before** the current step are considered to be validated steps.

You can therefore apply to the `.mc-stepper__item` element of these validated steps, the modifier `mc-stepper__item--validated`.

In addition to adding the `mc-stepper__item--validated` modifier, you must also replace the content of the `mc-stepper__indicator` element with an icon indicating that the step has been validated.

```html
<li class="mc-stepper__item mc-stepper__item--validated">
  <div class="mc-stepper__indicator" aria-hidden="true">
    <svg class="mc-stepper__icon">
      <use xlink:href="#icon" />
    </svg>
  </div>
  <div class="mc-stepper__detail">
    <span class="mc-stepper__title">Step 2 / 4</span>
    <span class="mc-stepper__label">Login</span>
  </div>
</li>
```

## Mobile behaviour

When the **Stepper** has **more than 3 steps**, it becomes difficult to display all the steps optimally on small screen resolutions.

**For this reason, we recommend only displaying the current step on these resolutions.**

To do this, you need to add the `mc-stepper--shrinked` modifier to the main `mc-stepper` element whenever your **Stepper** has more than 3 steps.

Adding this modifier will keep only the current step visible on resolutions below the `M (< 680px)` breakpoint.

```html
<nav class="mc-stepper mc-stepper--shrinked">
  <!-- following code here -->
</nav>
```
