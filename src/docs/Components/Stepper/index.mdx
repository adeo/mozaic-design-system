- Next step

## Behaviours

The current step is the most visible element to help the users.

Validated steps are mentioned by a check icon and users can use the stepper like a navigation element and go back to the previous steps.
However, they can't navigate to the next step with the stepper, they need to validate the current step with the solution suggested on the page.
