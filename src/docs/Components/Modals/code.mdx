## Import

Import the **settings**, the **modal**, the **bodys**, and the **button** scss files.

> Note that you can also implement in addition the scss file of **the links** if you use this component in your modals.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/_all-settings';

@include import-font-families();

@import 'typography/_t.bodys';
@import 'components/_c.modal';
@import 'components/_c.button';
```

## Usage

A modal is composed of several zones:

- **A header** with the class : `mc-modal__header`
- **A body** with class: `mc-modal__body`
- **A footer** with class: `mc-modal__footer`

These areas are then encompassed in:

- A specific container with the class: `mc-modal__dialog`
- A global wrapper with the class: `mc-modal`

```html
<div class="example">
  <div
    class="mc-modal"
    tabindex="-1"
    role="dialog"
    aria-labelledby="modalTitle"
    aria-hidden="true"
  >
    <div class="mc-modal__dialog" role="document">
      <div class="mc-modal__header">
        <h2 class="mc-modal__title" id="modalTitle">Modal Title</h2>
        <button class="mc-modal__close" type="button">
          <span class="mc-modal__close-text">Close</span>
        </button>
      </div>
      <div class="mc-modal__body">
        <article class="mc-modal__content">
          <h3 class="mc-modal__heading">Title</h3>
          <p class="mt-body-m">Content paragraph</p>
        </article>
      </div>
      <div class="mc-modal__footer">
        <button type="button" class="mc-button">
          <span class="mc-button__label">Button label</span>
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Detail of areas

In more detail, it should be noted that each of the fields mentioned above may contain other elements. Thus:

#### The header

The header contains:

- the title of the modal _(`.mc-modal__title`)_
- as well as its close button _(`.mc-modal__close`)_

> These elements are mandatory and must always be present in your modal code.

#### The body

The body can contain:

- a heading _(`.mc-modal__heading`)_
- as well as paragraph elements _(`.mt-body-m`)_

> Note that the heading is an optional element

#### The footer

The footer is the area that allows you to insert call-to-actions. This zone must always be present in your modals, and can contain one or more elements. [See details about the footer.](/Components/Modals/#modal-footer)

> Note that call to actions always take 100% of the modal's width on `breakpoint-s`.

<Preview path="default" />

## Variations

### Without heading

In cases where it is not necessary, you can use a modal without heading, as follows:

<Preview path="withouttitle" />

### Footer - two call to actions

A primary call to action button accompanied with a secondary button to give the user an alternative choice.

<Preview path="cta-two" />

### Footer - call to action and link

A primary call to action button with a link to redirect the user to a page to give more informations.

<Preview path="cta-link" />

## Behaviour

### Max-width

Modals are responsive elements, therefore with a variable width depending on the screen resolution.
Thus the width of a modal varies as follows:

| Breakpoint | Modal max-width |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| S          | 100%            |
| M          | 50%             |
| L          | 33%             |
| XL         | 66%             |
| XXL        | 50%             |

### Max-height

Just as the width of a modal varies according to the rules indicated above, the height of the modal also has max-height rules of variation:

| Breakpoint | Modal max-height |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| S          | 100%             |
| M          | 1:2 screen       |
| L          | 2:3 screen       |
| XL         | 2:3 screen       |
| XXL        | 1:2 screen       |

### On opening

During the opening of a modal by Javascript, several events occur:

- Added the `mc-modal-open` class to the body to prevent the default scrolling of the browser window.
- A `mc-modal-overlay` element is generated in the DOM.

<Preview path="opening" />
