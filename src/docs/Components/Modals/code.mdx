## Import

Import the **settings**, the **modal**, the **bodys**, and the **button** scss files.

> Note that you can also implement in addition the scss file of **the links** if you use this component in your modals.

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/all-settings';
@import 'typography/t.bodys';
@import 'components/c.divider';
@import 'components/c.modal';
@import 'components/c.button';
@import 'components/c.overlay';
```

## Usage

A modal is composed of several zones:

- **A header** with the class : `mc-modal__header`
- **A body** with class: `mc-modal__body`
- **A footer** with class: `mc-modal__footer`

These areas are then encompassed in:

- A specific container with the class: `mc-modal__dialog`
- A global wrapper with the class: `mc-modal`

```html
<div class="example">
  <div
    class="mc-modal"
    tabindex="-1"
    role="dialog"
    aria-labelledby="modalTitle"
    aria-hidden="true"
  >
    <div class="mc-modal__dialog" role="document">
      <header
        class="mc-modal__header mc-divider-bottom mc-divider-bottom--light"
      >
        <h2 class="mc-modal__title" id="modalTitle">Modal Title</h2>
        <button class="mc-modal__close" type="button">
          <span class="mc-modal__close-text">Close</span>
        </button>
      </header>
      <main class="mc-modal__body">
        <article class="mc-modal__content">
          <h3 class="mc-modal__heading">Title</h3>
          <div class="mc-modal__inner mt-body-m">
            <p>Content paragraph</p>
          </div>
        </article>
      </main>
      <footer class="mc-modal__footer">
        <button type="button" class="mc-button">
          <span class="mc-button__label">Button label</span>
        </button>
      </footer>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Detail of areas

In more detail, it should be noted that each of the fields mentioned above may contain other elements. Thus:

#### The header

The header contains:

- the title of the modal _(`.mc-modal__title`)_
- as well as its close button _(`.mc-modal__close`)_

> These elements are mandatory and must always be present in your modal code.

#### The body

The body can contain:

- a content area _(`.mc-modal__content`)_
- a heading _(`.mc-modal__heading`)_
- as well as an inner content where you can add paragraph elements _(`.mc-modal__inner.mt-body-m`)_

> Note that the heading is an optional element

#### The footer

The footer is the area that allows you to insert call-to-actions. This zone must always be present in your modals, and can contain one or more elements. [See details about the footer.](/Components/Modals/#modal-footer)

> Note that call to actions always take 100% of the modal's width on `breakpoint-s`.

## Variations

### Header with icon

As detailed above, you can add an icon in the header. You can do this in the following way:

<Story id="overlay-modal--header-with-icon" height="530" />

> The width of the icon is 24px _(`$mu150`)_

### Scrolling long content

<Story id="overlay-modal--with-long-content" height="530" />

### Footer - two call to actions

A primary call to action button accompanied with a secondary button to give the user an alternative choice.

<Story id="overlay-modal--cta-with-two-buttons" height="530" />

### Footer - call to action and link

A primary call to action button with a link to redirect the user to a page to give more informations.

<Story id="overlay-modal--cta-with-link" height="530" />

## Behaviour

### Max-width

Modals are responsive elements, therefore with a variable width depending on the screen resolution.
Thus the width of a modal varies as follows:

| Breakpoint | Modal width    |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| S          | 100%           |
| M          | 38,5mu (616px) |
| L          | 48mu (768px)   |
| XL         | 50mu (800px)   |
| XXL        | 56,5mu (904px) |

### Max-height

Just as the width of a modal varies according to the rules indicated above, the height of the modal also has max-height rules of variation:

| Breakpoint | Modal max-height                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| S          | 100% (16px margin-top and bottom) |
| M          | 1:2 screen                        |
| L          | 2:3 screen                        |
| XL         | 2:3 screen                        |
| XXL        | 1:2 screen                        |

### On opening

During the opening of a modal by Javascript, several events occur:

- Added the `is-open` class on the `mc-modal__dialog` element.
- A `mc-overlay` element is generated in the DOM. This element must also have the class `is-visible`.

<Story id="overlay-modal--default" height="530" />

#### Prevent body from scrolling

When you use a modal, by definition, it opens on top of the content of your page.

But depending on your context of use, you may need to prevent the user from scrolling the page in the background of your modal.

That's why **Mozaic** provides you with a css utility class allowing you to lock the use of scroll.

To do this, you need to add the `.mu-prevent-body-scroll` class to both the `html` and `body` tags.

When using this utility class, do not forget to import the associated SCSS file:

```scss
@import 'utilities/u.scroll';
```

> Note that the use of this class is not imposed by Mozaic but left to your discretion.
