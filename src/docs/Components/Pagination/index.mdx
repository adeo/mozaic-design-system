> Pagination enables users to navigate from a page to another one, especially when a large content needs to be splitted in several parts. It's mainly used on pages like the search engine result page or the list pages.

## Variations

### Horizontal navigation

There are two mechanics in this case. You can use the arrows to go on previous or next pages, or you can used the select to go on the wanted page.

**Horizontal pagination gives you the following informations:**

- A visual information to indicate the page where you are.
- A button to navigate to the previous page
- A button to navigate to the next page.

### Vertical navigation
