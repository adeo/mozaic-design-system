## Variations

### Horizontal navigation

**Horizontal pagination gives you the following informations:**

- A visual information to indicate the page where you are _(Default version)_.
- A button to navigate to the previous page.
- A button to navigate to the next page.

#### Default version

There are two mechanics in this case. You can use the arrows to go on previous or next pages, or you can used the select to go on the wanted page.

#### Compact version
