> The Menu is a useful component for creating a sub-navigation within a content page.  
It allows users to move seamlessly from one type of content to another, all of which are closely related and located in the same page hierarchy. As a sub-level of navigation, it follows the main navigation and tabbed navigation.  
Unlike the [Segmented control](/Components/SegmentedControl/), the menu has no comparative function. Instead, it allows users to move seamlessly between different types of content in the same context, similar to [Tabs](/Components/Tabs/).  
Ultimately, this keeps users engaged and on the same page, while adding complexity and variation to the overall content experience.

    Please, note that the Menu is a beta component and it will be improved
  through the following sprints.
