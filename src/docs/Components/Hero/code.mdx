## Import

```scss
@import 'settings-tools/_all-settings';

@import 'typography/_t.all-base-typography';
@import 'layouts/_l.container';
@import 'layouts/_l.flexy';
@import 'components/_c.hero';
```

## Basic usage

In its simplest form, the **Hero** component consists of the following elements:

- A global wrapper with the class: `mc-hero`
- A container with the classes: `ml-container` and `ml-container--fluid`
- A main content area: `mc-hero__main`
- An image covering the background of the component: `mc-hero__cover`

```html
  <div class="mc-hero">
    <div class="ml-container ml-container--fluid">
      <div class="ml-flexy ml-flexy--gutter">
        <div class="mc-hero__main ml-flexy__col">
          <picture class="mc-hero__cover">
            <img
              class="mc-hero__visual"
              src="https://m1.lmcdn.fr/media/15/5e611393475ea771bbbad626/2872342965/greenkub-maison-sans-permis5e611393063b330009a4a405.jpg?width=800&crop=16:9,smart"
              alt=""
            />
          </picture>

          <h1
            class="mc-hero__title 
            mt-heading
            mt-heading--lightest
            mt-heading--s 
            mt-heading--underline"
          >
            Hero title
          </h1>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

### Elements detail

#### The container

The **container** div allows you to use the Hero component in its fixed or fluid version by applying the following classes:
- `ml-container`: for a fixed container
- `ml-container ml-container--fluid`: for a fluid container

> For more details on the behaviour of the Moza√Øc container, do not hesitate to consult [the documentation dedicated](/Foundations/Layout/Container/) to it.

#### The main content area

The main content area _(`mc-hero__main`)_ is the area where **the cover image** of your component and **the component title** are located.

It is also possible to add **text content** within this area.

<u>The title</u>

The title of your component must be a [Mozaic's Heading](/Foundations/Typography/HeadingStyles/) and must therefore have the following structure:

```html
<h1 class="mc-hero__title mt-heading mt-heading--lightest mt-heading--s mt-heading--underline">
  Hero title
</h1>
```

> Note that the **Heading** you use in the **Hero** component must always be an [underlined heading](/Foundations/Typography/HeadingStyles/#underlined-headings).

<br/>
<u>The text content</u>

The text content must be inserted in a `mc-hero__content` div with the additional `mt-body-m` class.

```html
<div class="mc-hero__content mt-body-m">
  <!-- Insert your content here -->
</div>
```

#### The background

As you saw in the previous section, the background coverage image of the Hero component must be within the `mc-hero__main` area.

This background is an HTML element `<picture>` with the class `mc-hero__cover`. <br/>It contains an HTML element `<img />` with the class `mc-hero__visual`.

```html
<div class="mc-hero__main ml-flexy__col">
  <picture class="mc-hero__cover">
    <img
      class="mc-hero__visual"
      src="https://m1.lmcdn.fr/media/15/5e611393475ea771bbbad626/2872342965/greenkub-maison-sans-permis5e611393063b330009a4a405.jpg?width=800&crop=16:9,smart"
      alt=""
    />
  </picture>
  <!-- After the picture element, you can insert the title and the content of your component  -->
</div>
```

<Highlight theme="tips" title="Take advantage of the picture element">

  The HTML **Picture** element allows you to load multiple image sources for different display/device scenarios.

## Variations

The Hero component comes with several variations allowing you to cover different use cases.

### Title only

This is the most minimal Hero case.

<Preview path="basic" />

### Title with text content (recommended)

This is the most common Hero case **we recommend to use**. <br/>This version is made of a headline, a text content and a background image.

When using this variation, you need to add the `mc-hero--with-content` modifier to the global `mc-hero` wrapper.

<Preview path="title-content" />

### Centered hero

You have the ability to center the main content of your Hero component.

To do this: 
- add the `mc-hero--center` modifier to the global `mc-hero` wrapper.
- also add the `mt-heading--center` modifier to the `mt-heading` title element.

<Preview path="title-centered" />

<Preview path="title-content-centered" />

### Title with text and boxed content

In specific cases, you need to take some content apart of the overall page layout, to put a feature forward for example.

Therefore you have the possibility to use a secondary content area within your component.

This secondary content area _(boxed content)_ should be inserted directly after the `mc-hero__main` element in a div `mc-hero__boxed`.

You also need to add the `mc-hero--with-boxed` modifier to the global `mc-hero` wrapper for optimal rendering.

```html
<div class="mc-hero mc-hero--with-boxed">
  <div class="ml-flexy ml-flexy--gutter">
    <div class="mc-hero__main ml-flexy__col">
      <!--  Find here the elements mc-hero__cover, mc-hero__title and mc-hero__content -->
    </div>
    <div class="mc-hero__boxed ml-flexy__col">
      <!-- Insert here your secondary content -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

<Preview path="boxed-content" nude />

<Highlight theme="warning">

  When using the `mc-hero--with-boxed` modifier, be careful not to apply in addition the `mc-hero--with-content` modifier to the `mc-hero` element.

  Indeed the `mc-hero--with-boxed` modifier manages the boxed content but also manages the behavior of the title and the main content area.

</Highlight>

<Highlight title="More about the boxed content position">

When using a boxed content, you should be aware that it is positioned as follows:

- Below the breakpoint **L** _(< 1024px)_, the boxed content will be positioned below the main content.
- From the breakpoint **L** and beyond _(>= 1024px)_, the boxed content will be automatically positioned to the right of the main content.

</Highlight>

<Highlight theme="tips">

In case you would like to keep the boxed content below the main content in **L** resolution, you can add the `mc-hero--boxed-l` modifier to the global `mc-hero` wrapper. 

If you use this modifier, the boxed content will be positioned to the right of the main content only from the **XL** breakpoint _(>= 1280px)_ and will therefore remain below the main content until this breakpoint is reached.
