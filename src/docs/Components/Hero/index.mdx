## Variations

The hero pattern is provided with three different versions to cover many cases.

### Title only hero

This is the most minimal hero case. This version is best used when you need to introduce a page with just an image and a title on top of it.

### Title with text hero

This is the most common hero case we recommend to use. This version is made of a headline, a text content and a background image.

### Title with text and boxed content

In specific cases, you need to take some content apart of the overall page layout, to put a feature forward, for example. That is why we provide a hero version with a boxed content either centered under the text content or aligned to the right.

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Be aware">

Please note that a hero must not be based on the image but on the text content.
