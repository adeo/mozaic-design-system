## Variations

We want to provide as many cases as possible so we created three different versions of heroes.

### Title only hero

This is the most minimal hero case you will find in Mozaïc Design System. This version is best used when you need to introduce a page with just an image and a title on top of it.

--title only preview--

### Title with text hero

This is the most common hero case we recommend to use. This version is made of a headline, a text content and a background image.

--title with text preview--

### Title with text and boxed content

Sometimes, you need to take some content apart of the overall page layout. That is why we provide a hero version with a boxed content either centered under the text content or aligned to the right.

--title with text and box preview--

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Be aware">

Please note that a hero must not be based on the image but on the text content.

</Highlight>
