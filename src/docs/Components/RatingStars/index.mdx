> Rating stars is a pattern you'll find in almost every website. It has **two main usages**. First, it allows the user to give feedback on the current experience with a product or a service. Second, it allows a brand to provide some informations on other user's opinion on a product or a service to make his choice easier.

## Variations

### For each use case we have one dedicated element :

#### Rating stars input

This allows the user to rate a product or a service. The user can only give an integer rate from 0 to 5 by clicking the corresponding star.

#### Rating stars result

This use case is made to display notes from 0 to 5. This case allows half values, like 2,5 stars for example. This case shows the results of user rated products or services.

### Sizes

We designed rating stars with modularity in mind. You will find four different sizes of these to adjust to your needs.

## Do's and don't

<HintItem dont="true">
  Never use single rating stars. They should always be displayed within a group
  of 5.
</HintItem>
<HintItem dont="true">
  mc-stars-input should always have a label that indicates the user the ability
  to rate the product or the service.
</HintItem>
<HintItem dont="true">
  Don't try to reinvent standards and stick to the 5 stars ratings.
</HintItem>
<HintItem dont="true">
  Always use real data with rating stars. Never fake data to enforce a product
  or a service quality.
</HintItem>
