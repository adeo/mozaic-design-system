> Rating stars is a pattern you'll find in almost every website. It has two main usages. First, it allows the user to give feedback on the current experience with a product or a service. Second, it allows a brand to provide some informations on other user's opinion on a product or a service to make his choice easier.

## Variations

<Preview path="stars-result-all-states" nude />

We have separated rating stars into `mc-stars-input` and `mc-stars-results`.

### mc-stars-input:
This allows the user to rate a product or a service. The user can only give an integer rate from 0 to 5 by clicking the corresponding star.

### mc-stars-results:
This use case is made to display notes from 0 to 5. This case allows half values, like 2,5 stars for example. This case shows the results of user rated products or services.

### Sizes

We designed rating stars with modularity in mind. You will find four different sizes of these to adjust to your needs.

|                 |                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |

## Do's and don't

<HintItem dont="true">
  Never use single rating stars. They should always be displayed within a group of 5.
</HintItem>
<HintItem dont="true">
  mc-stars-input should always have a label that indicates the user the ability to rate the product or the service.
</HintItem>
<HintItem dont="true">
  Don't try to reinvent standards and stick to the 5 stars ratings.
</HintItem>
<HintItem dont="true">
  Always use real data with rating stars. Never fake data to enforce a product or a service quality.
