Mozaic is the ADEOâ€™s multi-brand Design System, powered by enthousiast designers and developers, designed to help set up a coherent human experience and reinforce the team's delivery time.
To meet our Customer-centric purposes, the design system offers a large catalogue of ready-to-use components.

## Philosophy

From the simplest to the most complex component, we have built the design system in a flexible way to improve it over the years and help product teams to deliver the best experiences.
Each component is documented and aims to answer the specifics needs of ADEO company and its brands.

There is no design without constraints. We take in consideration the following criteria:

- Design standards
- Ergonmy
- Accessibility
- Technical feasibility
- Functional first
