title: 'Preset Adeo'

Mozaic is designed to be above all the design system of the LEROY MERLIN brand.

However, we also offer you the possibility to extend Mozaic to meet specific customization needs.

It is in this context that we have set up the possibility of customizing Mozaic to meet the needs of LEROY MERLIN's parent company: ADEO.

Indeed, Mozaic natively embeds a **preset**, allowing to automatically override all the native LEROY MERLIN colors with those specific to ADEO.

Here's how to use this feature:

## mozaic.config.js

The file `mozaic.config.js` allows you to extend the configuration of Mozaic _(you can learn more about this file by [reading the dedicated page](/GetStarted/Developers/Configuration/))_.

In order to use the **Adeo preset**, you must create at the root of your project a file `mozaic.config.js` _(if it does not already exist)_ and follow these steps:

### 1 - Set the preset property

In the `mozaic.config.js` file you must add a `preset` property and give it `adeo` as value:

```js
module.exports = {
  preset: 'adeo',
}
```

### 2 - Define your local Token Export Path

Using the ADEO preset, Mozaic will generate a series of tokens for you to use in your project.

In order to make it easier for you to see and use these tokens, you must define your local token export path.  To do this, you must add the following code to the `mozaic.config.js` file, in addition to the elements already included:

```js
module.exports = {
  preset: 'adeo',
  tokens: {
    localTokensExportPath: './dest/build/', // path to compiled files
  }
}
```

In that way the SCSS will load the customized ones instead of the ones living in the npm package.

### 3 - Compiling tokens

Great! You are about to be able to use the ADEO preset, but you still have one last step to take: Compiling tokens.

In order to compile tokens, you have two options:

#### The mozaic-tokens:build command

run directly :

```shell
mozaic-tokens:build
```

or though a `package.json` script for example :

```Json
...
"scripts": {
  "develop": "mozaic-tokens:build && npm run develop:watch",
}
...
```

#### Using the js funtion

If you want to trigger the tokens build inside a node script, you can use the function provided by Mozaic :

```js
const tokensBuild = require('@mozaic-ds/tokens/tokensBuild')

tokensBuild()
```

When triggering the either the command or the function, if you override values, you should see something like this logging into the console :

```
Property Value Collisions:
Collision detected at: color.primary-01.100! Original value: #EAF3E2, New value: #000
```
