## Mozaic for developers

We put at your disposal several packages, which will allow you to use all aspects of Mozaic in your project.

Note that all packages associated with the Mozaic project, are public repositories on NPM and are grouped under the scope `@mozaic-ds/**`.

The installation of a Mozaic package is done like a classical installation of an NPM package:

<CH.Code>

```bash npm
npm install --save @mozaic-ds/<name-of-your-package>
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @mozaic-ds/<name-of-your-package>
```

</CH.Code>

> Installing Mozaic packages require `node v18+`

## Mozaic packages

### Available packages

The Mozaic packages which may interest you are the following:

- `@mozaic-ds/styles`: source `.scss` files
- `@mozaic-ds/tokens`: tokens json sources as well as compiled ones
- `@mozaic-ds/web-fonts`: the webfonts used by Mozaic
- `@mozaic-ds/icons`: the icon svg files library
- `@mozaic-ds/css-dev-tools`: tools for css like PostCSS plugins and linters config

### About our .scss files

The `@mozaic-ds/styles` package uses **Dart Sass**, which is [the new official implementation](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) of **Sass**.

Therefore, when installing the `@mozaic-ds/styles` package, please also install **Dart Sass** in your project:

```bash
npm install --save @mozaic-ds/styles sass@latest
```

> We recommend that you use a version of the sass package >= 1.34.0

<Highlight theme="warning" title="Node Sass is deprecated">

Since version **1.6.0** of Mozaic, the `@mozaic-ds/styles` package no longer uses **Node Sass** to compile our **.scss** files into **css**.

Indeed, [Node Sass has been deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) by the Sass core team.

### About tokens

<Highlight theme="tips" title="Tokens as styles dependency">

When you install the `@mozaic-ds/styles` package, you also implicitly install the `@mozaic-ds/tokens` package.

Indeed, the package `@mozaic-ds/tokens` is a dependency of the package `@mozaic-ds/styles`.
