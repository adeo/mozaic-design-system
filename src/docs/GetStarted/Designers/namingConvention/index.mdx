> Mozaic is a product used by a lot of people. When so many people work together from different places on such a big project, you need to establish some ground rules that everyone needs to follow. These rules must be followed across every tool your team is using to create consistency and simplify the collaboration process.

## File Naming Conventions

The prefix must contain two letters depending on the pattern type and look like that: **_[XX] File name_**

| Prefix   | Pattern type        | Example                                |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **[AA]** | Styles              | Colors, icons, fonts, shapes, ...      |
| **[BA]** | Simple Components   | Buttons, links, tags, forms, ...       |
| **[BB]** | Complex Components  | Notifications, accordions, popins, ... |
| **[ZZ]** | Specific librairies | Tools, documentation, ...              |

## Sketch

Please follow these rules to have the same architecture and standards in every library. This will be very helpful for the design teams to understand the files we produce in Mozaic.

- **English:** every file, layer, symbol and so on must be named in english.

### Artboard / Symbols naming

We use **PascalCase** for the naming of our symbols and our artboards. Pascal case combines words by capitalizing all words, even the first word and removing the space. For example, `user login count` in raw text becomes `UserLoginCount` in PascalCase.

**We use this categorisation to create consistency in our libraries :**

| Categrory             | Usage                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ðŸ‘¾ For developers** | These symbols should not be used in your designs. They are meant to share the different states of a component with the development team.                 |
| **ðŸ›  ToolKit**         | This section contains the symbols used to build the final symbols. They are not meant to be used directly but to be accessible through symbol overrides. |
| **Component**         | This is where you'll find the ready to use symbols of the library.                                                                                       |

**Tips to create hierarchy:**

- We use numbers as prefixes to order components depending on their importance. For example, `Button / 01-Solid / 01-S / 01- Primary`

- We use a double hyphen as suffixes to indicate a scecific information. For example, `Button / 01-Solid / 01-S / 01- Primary--Campus`

### Layers naming

#### Shapes

Please use the following naming conventions for your shapes :

- Frame: frame is the combination of a **background** and an **outline**
- Divider: this allows you to break the rhythm of the page
- Shadow: â€¦

| Type        | Description                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frame**   | Frame is the combination of a **background** and an **outline** |
| **Divider** | This allows you to break the rhythm of the page                 |
| **Shadow**  | ...                                                             |

<hintitem>
  Always rename your layers to have an understable file for others.
</hintitem>

<hintitem dont="true">
  Never use layer names like _rectangle_, _oval_, etc.
</hintitem>

#### Icons

Please follow these instructions for the naming of your icon in the layer list.

- Choose the icon here ðŸ‘‡: use this naming if your icon is overridable
- Icon's action: if your icon isn't overridable please summarise what action it does. For example **Close Icon**

#### Images

Two cases are available for naming images layers.

- Picture:
- Illustration:

#### Texts

- Content: content can be just one or a combination of the following elements :
  - Title
  - Subtitle
  - Paragraph
  - Mention
  - Link
- Label: when using _label_, please explain what label it is. For example **Button label**

### Abstract

#### Branches

The prefix must contain the last two digits of the current year and the number of the week followed by the name file :

> [Year.Week] File name
>
> > _ **[19.40] Buttons** _

#### Child Branches

> [YY.WW] Component name + Action (Major, Minor, Fix)
>
> > _ **[19.40] Buttons - Fix ** _

#### Commits message

Commits are a testimony of your work on your files. Use them to make a summary of what's been done during the creation process.

Modified file : Major (add accordion) _ Device if needed
Modified file : Minor (refoactor for campus) _ Device if needed
Modified file : Fix (responsive bug) \* Device if needed
