## Tools

### Sketch

#### Rules to follow

When you're working for Mozaic, you will probably use Sketch for your designs. The core team has established some ground rules to follow to have an coherent user experience from all across the BU's that are using the product.

- **PascalCase:** Pascal case combines words by capitalizing all words, even the first word and removing the space. For example:
  - Raw : `user login count`
  - Pascal Case : `UserLoginCount`
- **English:** every file, layer, symbol and so on must be named in english.

#### Artboard / Symbols naming

#### Layers naming

##### Shapes

Please use the following naming conventions for your shapes in your Sketch files.

- Frame: frame is the combination of a **background** and an **outline**
- Divider: this allows you to break the rhythm of the page
- Shadow: â€¦

<hintitem>
  Always rename your layers to have an understable file for others.
</hintitem>

<hintitem dont="true">
  Never use layer names like _rectangle_, _oval_, etc.
</hintitem>

##### Icons

Please follow these instructions for the naming of your icon in the layer list.

- Choose the icon here ðŸ‘‡: use this naming if your icon is overridable
- Icon's action: if your icon isn't overridable please summarise what action it does. For example **Close Icon**

##### Images

Two cases are available for naming images layers.

- Picture:
- Illustration:

##### Texts

- Content: content can be just one or a combination of the following elements :
  - Title
  - Subtitle
  - Paragraph

- Label: when using _label_, please explain what label it is. For example **Button label**
