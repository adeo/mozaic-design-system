## UI Kits

<Highlight type="warning" title="Figma Variables">

Version 2 of the ADEO Design System is currently being designed and will provide a brand-new UI Kit made with Figma's Variables. Current UI Kits will be unpublished following the release of the new version.

We offer various UI Kits, depending on the brand you work for.
Here is the brands covered by the design system:

<Highlight type="tips" title="Good to know">
  Each component has its own Figma file to facilitate maintenance and to avoid
  designers loading everything if they only need a certain number of components
  on their mock-ups.
