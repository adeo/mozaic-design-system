_As designers_, the **Mozaic design system** provide you with a lot of ready to use **patterns**.

## What is a pattern ?

A pattern is a **repeating** or **reusable element** of the inferface like colors, text styles, icons, buttons or any generic components.  
It can be applied or modified to meet a specific design problem, a user need, evoke an emotion, reinforce the brand management.

## The Mozaic design system UI Kit

The UI Kit is a set of sketch files to be used as libraries.  
It contains all **core styles** as well as a collection of **reusable components** based on those core styles.

> We recommend that you go to the [What's included?](/GetStarted/Designers/whatsIncluded/) page to read the contents of the kit before using them.

### About the UI Kit versions

Each UI Kit version correspond to the same design system version and use the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) naming convention.

All patterns are available at the same time with a common version number for both designers and developers.

> For example: The button you will get in the _v 1.0.5_ of the UI kit will be the same as the button available for developers in the _v 1.0.5_ of the source code.
