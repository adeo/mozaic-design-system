## Introduction
Hello, welcome to our Design System MultiBU _yeah, that's a poor name we came up with just for the sake of calling it something else than design system, you can help us on finding a new name on our [slack channel](adeo-tech-community.slack.com)_. With a modular approch, we intend to serve ADEO with a flexbile design system that allows Business Units to develop it's digital products. 
All our (design principles)[https://design-system-adeo.appspot.com/Principles/], (rules and conventions)[https://github.com/adeo/design-system--styleguide/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md] are listed here as well as everything you need to have consistent interactions up and running for real humans to use. 


### The goal is to help teams on focusing more on creating interaction to solve outcomes than designing pretty features. 

### It's worth to mention that this is a living system, still in it's earliest stages. So, bare with us for a little and this will be something great in no time... at least, we expect! :)
You can report any bug or request a feature or improvment [filling an issue here](https://github.com/adeo/design-system--styleguide/issues)
