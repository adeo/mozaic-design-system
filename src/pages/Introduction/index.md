## Introduction
Hello, welcome to our Design System. Here you will find everything you need to design and develop a digital product in Adeo. All our design principles, rules and conventions are listed here as well as everything you need to have consistent interactions up and running for real humans to use. 

### The goal is to help teams on focusing more on creating interaction to solve outcomes than designing pretty features.
