### Sincere
The tone employed must reflect our sincerity.
We do not seek to embellish artificially, to disguise reality, or even to hide the truth.
Let's be real while raising the projection. So no promise without proof.
And no sycophancy: our sincerity must embody our desire for a healthy relationship.


### Serene
Our words must give confidence. Avoid excess, stress that can arouse communication that angst or guilt. The energy that drives us should not result in agitation.
