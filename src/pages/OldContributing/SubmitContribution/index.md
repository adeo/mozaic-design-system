## As a BU i need a new feature

### Create an issue

In the github project, you have to create a new issue following the issue template `ðŸ’Ž Pattern addition proposal`.

In the issue, you have to write a clear and concise description of the component: 
* The use case
* The reason why to implement it to MOZAIC
* The variations
* (optionnal) - Screenshots or design files
* (optionnal) - Actuel SCSS code files

### Next steps

The MOZAIC team will assist you in the design of a compatible design for all BUs, in the technical design and in the structuring of the documentation so that you can propose a pull request in line with MOZAIC standards.

## As a BU i already develop a component and i want to submit it to MOZAIC

> **We recommand you to take time** to read actual documentation and take note of the availables foundations, mixins, variables

As the component is already develop, you can decide to submit it directly without any validation from the MOZAIC Core Team.

1. Sketch files, [Design contributing](/Contributing/Design)
2. SCSS files, [Development contributing](/Contributing/Development)
