###Sketch App
> We are currently working on version 53 of Sketch.

All our patterns are currently designed on **Sketch**. <br>
Styles & components consist of several files to use as libraries.

[You can find the version of Sketch that we use here.](https://www.sketchapp.com/updates/#version-53)
<br>
<br>
<br>
_**Plugin to use with Sketch :**_
<br>
<br>
For an optimal compatibility of Sketch libraries, we recommend to use the **Anima app** plugin.<br>
<br>
We use it to add the follows features to Sketch :
* Stack: It allows to stack patterns between them, and to modify automatically the margin according to the height or width of the block.
* Padding: It allows to generate an automatic padding.
