*As designers*, the **LEROY MERLIN Design System** provide you with a lot of ready to use **patterns**.<br>
<br>
**What is a pattern?**<br>
A pattern is a **repeating** or **reusable element** of the inferface like colors, text styles, icons, buttons and many generic components.<br>
It can be applied or modified to meet a specific design problem, a need of the user, evoke an emotion, reinforce the brand management.


#UI Kit
It contains sketch files to use as libraries for your projects, and consist **the core style** and **the all resulting components**.

>We recommend that you read the [What's included ?](whatsIncluded/) page to read the contents of the kit before using them.

<br>

###About the versioning convention

Each UI Kit version correspond to the same design system version and use the <a href="https://semver.org" target="blank">semantic versioning</a> naming convention.

All patterns are available at the same time with a common version number for both designers and developers.
> For example: The button you will get in the *v 1.0.5* of the UI kit will be the same as the button available for developers in the *v 1.0.5* of the source code.
