As designers, the **LEROY MERLIN Design System** provide you a lots of patterns ready to use like :<br>
text styles, colors swatches, icons for web & print support, and many generic components.

#UI Kit
It contains sketch files to use as libraries for your projects.<br>
<br>
Each UI Kit correspond to the same design system version.

The same patterns (documentation, code, UI kit components and styles) are available at the same time under the same version number for designers as well as for developpers.

It means that the button you will get in the v1.0.5 of the UI kit will be the same as the button available for developpers in the v1.0.5 of the source code.

Each versions use the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) naming convention.
