###Sketch App
> We are currently working on version 53 of Sketch.

![sketchapp](getting-started-sketch.jpg)

All our patterns are currently designed on **Sketch**. <br>
Styles & components consist of several files to use as libraries.

[You can find the version of Sketch that we use here.](https://www.sketchapp.com/updates/#version-53)
<br>
<br>
####Sketch plugins

For an optimal compatibility of Sketch libraries, it's required to use the **Anima app** plugin.<br>
<br>
We use it to add the following features to Sketch :
* Stack: Allow you to stack elements together, and to modify automatically their margin according to the height and width of the containing block.
* Padding : Allow you to generate paddings automatically.
