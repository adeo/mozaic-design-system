## Presentation

>An icon is a graphic representation of an object, a message or a movement. It's different from an illustration because of its simplistic aspect. An **icon must be recognisable at first sight** so that the user can understand the information or the action it is intended to represent. Icons may be a visual guide to help the user to navigate on leroymerlin.fr faster.

## Principles

#### 1. Easy to understand
Icon's shape must be easy for the user to understand its purpose without overthinking it.

#### 2. Abstract
Icon can represent abstract ideas. In that case, its meaning is more about the concept than reality.

#### 3. Visible
An icon must be easy to identify in the middle of interfaces.

#### 4. Outlined
We decided to use outlined icons to have a lighter result in our designs.

Icons allows to emphasise an action et make it easier to understand. An icon can be used in a button without a label to gain space in interfaces.
