Heading styles are patterns meant to help you use consistent typographic hierarchy with the context and across responsive viewports. It's mainly reserved for users wishing to focus on tasks with added value and user experience. Text classes are families of several font-sizes and help create a hierarchy of contents.

#### They are defined with three factors :

- Font-size _(that may vary depending on the viewport)_
- Line-height _(that are optimised for readability and accessibility)_
- Font-weight _(regular or semi-bold)_

#### And comes with two variations for each classe :

Each body pattern comes with a modifier to set the font-weight to **'semi bold'** and a modifier to use an alternative **line-height**.
