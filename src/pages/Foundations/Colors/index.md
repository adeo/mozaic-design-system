> Color is something the team worked on a lot. We wanted an adaptive and a scalable color system. Our colors have been defined using **HSLA color swatches**. The color pallete has been divided in three categories : **primary colors**, **secondary colors** and **greys**.

# Primary colors

Primary colors are the brand colors. They are the key components for our users to live and adopt the Leroy Merlin's experience. These are the two primary colors palletes we use in this design system.

## Primary 01

This primary green is the essence of the brand Leroy Merlin.

## Primary 02

This primary blue is what defines consumer education in Leroy Merlin.

## Grayscale

We used the same principles to design our greyscale but greys are based on **11 values** swatches. Greys have specific use cases for **UI elements** :

- Texts & Titles
- Icons
- Backgrounds

# Secondary colors

Secondary colors are essential to our designs. We need them in many occasions to accent our primary colors and to deliver a specific message such as discounts and special offers.

## Secondary Blue

Secondary Blue is mostly used for focus or informative contents.

## Secondary Purple

Secondary Purple is used for illustration purposes.

## Secondary Red

Secondary Red is for discounts, alerts and errors.

<pattern path="src/patterns/--colors/secondary-red"></pattern>

## Secondary Orange

Secondary Orange is for warning.

## Secondary Yellow

Secondary Yellow is for illustrations and special offers.
