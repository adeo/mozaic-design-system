> Mozaic is a worldwide source of truth when it comes to design for Adeo and Leroy Merlin's products. That is why you need to use general guideline when you design for Mozaic. We specially made some guidelines to follow when designing new symbols.

This **Definition of Done** page has been divided in 10 steps.

## Step 1

#### The pattern doesn't exist in Mozaic
I checked that the pattern is not in another library :
- I looked over Mozaic‚Äôs website (Foundations / Components)
- I checked on GitHub (Pull requests)
- I checked on Jira (Issues in the kanban board)

## Step 2

#### The pattern is stored in the right file
I checked that my pattern is in the right Sketch library and it‚Äôs in somewhere that makes sense.

## Step 3

#### The naming conventions have been respected in my file
A design system needs to respond to a certain number of criterias. Naming conventions is one of the most important.

## Step 4

#### Every symbols are usable and responsive
Before asking for review you need to make sure that every symbol in your library is usable and responsive. Usable means --‚Ä¶--. Responsive means that the symbol can be resized depending on your needs.

## Step 5

#### Layer styles and text styles have been applied on the different components
We created layer and text styles to make the symbol creation process easier. Thank you for making sure to use them ü§ò. This will also make the update process way faster.

## Step 6

#### Paddings and margins use magic unit values (1mu = 16px)
Every element must use our magic unit standard which is 1 magic unit for 16 pixels.

## Step 7

#### Every patterns coming from other libraries are up to date
Thank you for checking that every patterns are up to date (look after the ‚ÄúLibrary update‚Äù notifications in Sketch ü§ì).

## Step 8

#### Layers are well organized and follow our guidelines
Layers should be organized in a top to bottom reading direction to make the override process easier. For example, the header needs to be on top of the layer list and the footer on the bottom of this list.

## Step 9

#### Non editable elements of the symbols are not available in the override panel
When symbol elements can‚Äôt be edited you need to lock the possibility to override them. This can be done easily with Sketch when you click on the symbol‚Äôs artboard.

## Step 10

#### I followed the logic of ‚öõÔ∏è atomic design ‚öõÔ∏è to build my symbol

I followed the atomic design logic to build my symbols.

--Give examples--
_A partir du moment o√π un √©l√©ments se r√©p√®te 2 fois, ils faut cr√©er un symbole qui l‚Äôont r√©p√©tera dans les diff√©rents symboles finaux. Cela permettra d‚Äô√™tre plus r√©actif √† chaques modifications et de ne pas appliquer des modifications sur chaques symboles un par un._
