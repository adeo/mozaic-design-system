> A toggle is used to choose between two possibilities and when the user needs instant feedback. It is common to use toggles when you need to show or hide content and "on/off" switch.

## Sizes

- `S` or small : used only on desktop when space is a concern
- `M` or medium (default): should be the exclusive size for touch devices, and be used in most of the cases on desktop
