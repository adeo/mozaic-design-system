> By default, the links inherit the style of their context, otherwise they are mainly used for **internal or external navigation actions**. In this case, their appearance is depending on the type of action required from the user, or the context.


## Variations

### Six color schemes for each type of action

You can use **primary**, **Light**, **Dark**, **Neutral**, & **danger** color scheme depending of the type of action the link trigger.
There is also an alternative primary color scheme, only used for Campus : **primary-campus**.

<preview path="src/pages/Components/Links/previews/link-styles"></preview>
