## Do's and don'ts

<hintitem>
You can cumulate diffÃ©rents states like that :
</hintitem>
<pattern path="src/patterns/--input/input-invalid-event"></pattern>

<hintitem dont=true>
when <strong>disabled</strong>, an input field can never display any other state styles.
</hintitem>
<pattern path="src/patterns/--input/input-default-disabled"></pattern>

## Accessibility
* **Input text must have an explicit label.**
* **Always use a label associated with an input <small>remember that a placeholder is not a replacement for a label !**</small>
