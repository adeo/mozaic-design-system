> Rating stars is a pattern you'll find in almost every website. It allows to do two different things. First, it allows the user to give a feedback on his experience with a product or a service. Second, it allows a brand to provide some informations on other user's opinion on a product or a service to make his choice easier.

## Variations

You can find three different versions of rating stars. One that represents empty stars, half stars and full stars.

| Variation       | Usage                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Empty stars     | Empty stars are shown when the user hasn't posted a review yet     |
| Half stars      | Half stars show an half rating of a user on a product or a service |
| Full stars      | Full stars show user's opinion on a product or a service           |
