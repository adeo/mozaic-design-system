## Concepts

Our design system is being thought with the [Atomic Design methodology](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), Inspired on the design systems created all over adeo like 
- [Garden, from Leroy Merlin Brazil](http://styleguide.leroymerlin.com.br),
- [Design System Leroy Merlin France](http://design-system.leroymerlin.fr),
- Cosmos, from Leroy Merlin Spain and others.
