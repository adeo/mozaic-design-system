# Typography
Content is king. To make content easy to read, a good set of typography is a must to set the right hierachy, emphasis and context on the stories being told.

To add a layer of personality and performance on our digital products, we have a family of web fonts available. They are organised into **heading** and **text** styles. 

## Type Scale 
To avoid hindering the design process and having front end semantic work-arounds, we have a hand full of font-sizes available with no distinction between heading, subheadings, text.

### It's important thought to highlight a few advices for:

#### Headings
It's size contributes to that, so we recommend headings to start form 24px size.
#### Paragraphs and regular texts
Starting on `14px`. 
#### Small disclaimers
Max size of `12px`. 

All units are measured in `px`, just for sake of simplicity. 

### Font Weights
Light
Normal
Bold
Italic
