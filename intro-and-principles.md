# Intro

'Adeo's Design System' _(we'll come up soon with a cool name)_ represents the new approach to Design inside Adeo and it's Business Units.
Our goal, is to make available for all developers a collection of **high-end visual components ready to use** without the need of beeing a master at front-end development. 

For know, all our visual assets are in `experimental phase` and our goal for the next 3-4 months is to increase the number of stable components that at the same time are easy to use and usefull for all product development cycles. 

As it's a `innersource project`, colaboration from all developers inside ADEO and it's business units are welcome! : ) And you can know more about that [here](https://github.com/adeo/design-system--front-end/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)



# Principles
Design at ADEO is what make concrete a outcome. Now-a-days a good experience is a key factor for a brand to be useful in people's lives. To understand how to create a good experience takes time, and our goal is to make easier to provide delightful experiences once you have a hand full of beautiful and meaningful design assets.


## Harmony
Isn't it amazing when we can almost predict the next step in a digital prodcut? That's a good outcome of a work of harmony and consistency. Our customers today trust on our brand and like our values. Our designs should be a extension of that, and even take it to the next level. 


## Usefulness
A great experience is made of delightful elements put together to give life for something, to solve real problems. By focusing on what's usefull we get to expend energy in what really matters for people with clarity, emphaty and focus.

## People first
In everything we do, at the end of the day we're doing it for someone. Doesn't matter if they are customers, suppliers or employees. That's why we should do our best to deliver a digital product with almost none barriers between people and technology.
