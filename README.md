# Adeo's Design System 
> ADEO - LMF - LMBR | Design System Team

**Why:** The goal is to speed up the workflow of designers and developers by providing well designed, developed and documented visual components.

**What:** Source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product

---------------------------------

## Summary

A design system unites product teams around a common visual language. It reduces design debt, accelerates the design process, and builds bridges between teams working in concert to bring products to life.

## Concepts

Our design system is being thought with the [Atomic Design methodology](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), Inspired on the design systems created all over adeo like 
- [Garden, from Leroy Merlin Brazil](http://styleguide.leroymerlin.com.br),
- [Design System Leroy Merlin France](http://design-system.leroymerlin.fr),
- Cosmos, from Leroy Merlin Spain and others.
