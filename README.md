# MOZAIC Design system

This repo contains the code and content to create, manage and deploy Mozaic's design system styleguide. The styleguide is based on gatsby, a static site generator based on react and graphql. Gatsby allows us to build static html websites that, once loaded on the client acts as a SPA.

Building a styleguide using a static site generator instead of relying on a database allow us to use a versionned styleguide that matches the assets and framework that it is based on.

We tried to focus on the developper experience, meaning that working with it should be as simple as possible.
