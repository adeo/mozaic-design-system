# MOZAIC Design system

This repo contain the code and content to create, manage and deploy the Mozaic design system styleguide.
the styleguide is based on gatsby, a static site generator based on react and graphql.
Gatsby allow us to build static html websites that, once loaded on the client act as a SPA.

building a styleguide using a static site generator instead of reliyng on a database allow us to use a versionned styleguide that match the assets and framework that it is based on.

We tryed to focus on developper experience, meaning that working with it should be as simple as possible.

## Development :

### Note about the project architecture

The project Use a monorepo architecture using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/).
Lerna help us to manage the distribution and the versionning of multiple packages into the same repository.
It also create symlink between the individual packages nodes_modules so they can be used in one another as npm dependencies.

When releasing the design system, lerna will automaticaly generate changelogs for the global/parent repo, as well as for the individual packages and select a version number based on the commit syntax. It's why it is very important that you follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/adeo/design-system--styleguide/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

please [read the docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/) to learn more about it.

## Targeting compillation of selected previews directory

Compiling previews take a long time, and most of the time you need only to compile the previews you are working on.

To target only previews contained in a directory, add a preview parameter to the develop command containing a path relative to `src/pages/`:

`yarn develop previews=Components/Buttons`

## Lint and fix your css files using stylelint

```bash
yarn css:fix
```

Please note that stylelint is not able to fix everything, so run

```bash
yarn css:lint
```

and make the required changes.

stylelint `fix` and `lint` are run at pre-commit, so you can't commit uggly stuffs ;).
